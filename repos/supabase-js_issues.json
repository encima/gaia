                    "body": "issue to discuss the specification of methods in supabase-js to invoke auth endpoints on auth/v1\r\n\r\nthe endpoints that will be targeted are:\r\n\r\n    `auth/v1/signup`\r\n    `auth/v1/login` (actually makes a claim on the gotrue /token endpoint. also does token refreshing)\r\n    `auth/v1/logout`\r\n    `auth/v1/recover`? (sends recovery email)\r\n    `auth/v1/user`? (returns current user details)\r\n    `auth/v1/verify`? (verifies a token sent over email to activate an account)\r\n    `auth/v1/invite`? (sends invite email)\r\n\r\nmore details regarding the function of the endpoints found [here](https://github.com/netlify/gotrue) (you'll have to scroll past the env vars to the relevant section)\r\n\r\ninitial idea discussed with @kiwicopple was to allow the user to create a single client and call methods on an auth namespace like:\r\n```javascript\r\nimport { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'\r\n\r\nconst supabase = createClient(URL, KEY)\r\n\r\nawait supabase.auth.signup(new_email, new_password)\r\nawait supabase.auth.login(email, password) // might also return jwt so it can be managed manually \r\nawait supabase.auth.logout()\r\n```\r\nsignup (if not requiring email confirmation) and login will set a cookie containing the auth-token, which will then be sent in a header for any call to logout, or calls to rest or realtime methods (subscribe(), select() etc.)",

Also, in hindsight, my question is actually really dumb, considering the operations I'm talking about (resetting passwords, confirming password tokens) are generally taken with unauthenticated users. So maybe that kind of info does NOT belong within the user auth object.  Anyway, looking forward to seeing what you smarter people decide is best practice.",

            "body": "## Decision\r\n\r\nWe've decided to make a major change to support a better developer experience for working with supabase-js. Instead of throwing an error, we will return the error object as part of the response.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nGiven a successful query, e.g. `const response = await supabase.from('products').select('*')`, `response` will be:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"error\": null,\r\n  \"data\": [...],\r\n  \"status\": 200,\r\n  \"statusCode\": 200,\r\n  \"statusText\": \"\",\r\n  \"body\": [...] // for backwards compatibility: `body === data`\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nGiven a bad query, e.g. `const response = await supabase.from('productx').select('*')`, `response` will be:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"error\": {\r\n    \"code\": 404,\r\n    \"message\": \"relation \\\"public.productx\\\" does not exist\",\r\n    \"details\": null,\r\n    \"hint\": null\r\n  },\r\n  \"data\": null,\r\n  \"status\": 404,\r\n  \"statusCode\": 404,\r\n  \"statusText\": \"\",\r\n  \"body\": null // for backwards compatibility: `body === data`\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Future DX\r\nThis will enable the following experience:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst { error, data: products } = await supabase.from('products').select('*')\r\nif (error) {\r\n  alert(error.message)\r\n  return // abort\r\n}\r\nconsole.log(`Found ${products.length} products.`)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\nInspiration has been taken from https://github.com/vercel/swr#quick-start:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport useSWR from 'swr'\r\n\r\nfunction Profile() {\r\n  const { data, error } = useSWR('/api/user', fetcher)\r\n\r\n  if (error) return <div>failed to load</div>\r\n  if (!data) return <div>loading...</div>\r\n  return <div>hello {data.name}!</div>\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nas well as Stripe.js : https://stripe.com/docs/js/payment_methods/create_payment_method\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5748289/92302379-51889c00-ef9e-11ea-8546-c64e38062ada.png)\r\n",

As you say, handling every possible error would be unwieldy. We should just shape expected errors.\r\n\r\n> so there's no need to use the data field in place of body.\r\n\r\nThis one is just a preference. I guess we should decide now what is the more appropriate name for the key. IMO `body` seems like a throwback to when we used ajax used to request HTML snippets that would be injected into HTML. \r\n\r\n> Currently the error handling looks more like this\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (!ok) { // status code is not 2XX\r\n  return // abort\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'd far prefer this one to look like the suggested change (`if (error)`). The term `ok` is unexpected, and `error` is very clear\r\n\r\n",

However it appeared to compile the js code without any issue. There may be specific knobs that svelte kit has tweaked which cause the `Unexpected token` error, but I am unsure.",

You may find helpful examples in [the Vite issue tracker](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues). The most common solutions would be to try moving the package between `dependencies` and `devDependencies` or trying to `include` or `exclude` it in `optimizeDeps`. Packages which use `exports` instead of `module.exports` are currently failing due to a [known Vite issue](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/2579). You should also consider asking the library author to distribute an ESM version of their package or even converting the source for the package entirely to ESM.\r\n>\r\n>You should also add any Svelte components to `ssr.noExternal`. [We hope to do this automatically in the future](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/904) by detecting the `svelte` field in a package's `package.json`.\r\n\r\nAs suggested, I just tried to `include` or `exclude` `@supabase/supabase-js`in `optimizeDeps` in my `svelte.config.cjs` under `vite` but this not only didn't work for prod, it also broke the previously working `npm run dev`.\r\n\r\nThat leads me to wonder if somewhere in the dependency tree, we need to ask some package maintainer to provide ESM support?",

            "body": "# Feature request\r\nadd an `unwrap()` method or a an either monad `left()` method to pull the data out of a postgrest response.\r\n\r\n## Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.\r\n\r\nNot exactly a problem, but the way the client is designed requires every database query to individually handle database failures. For the most part, I want to assume that the query succeeded, and throw an error if it did not. That makes most of my db calls look like this:\r\n```ts\r\n  const res = await context.supabase\r\n    .from<tables['my_table']>('my_table')\r\n    .select()\r\n    .filter('status', 'eq', 'COMPLETED')\r\n    .limit(1)\r\n  if (res.error) throw new Error(`SupabaseError: query failed: \\n${res.error}`)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Describe the solution you'd like\r\nThe solution I would like best, would be to add a method which can optionally unwrap the `{ error: object } | { data: object[] }` response from supabase into just the data field. If there is an error present, the client should throw an error. This should not break any existing workflows, its just an optional convenience method.\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n```ts\r\nconst data: table['my_table'] = await supabase.from<table['my_table']>('my_table')\r\n  .select()\r\n  .unwrap()\r\n\r\n// handling an error:\r\ntry {\r\n  const data = await supabase.from('my_table').delete().unwrap()\r\n} catch (e) {\r\n  if (e.name === 'SupabaseError') {\r\n    // handle it\r\n  } else {\r\n    throw e\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nI have attempted building this on top of the supabase client, but because of the way queries are built, I need to use proxies:\r\n```ts\r\n  const supabase_proxy_handler = {\r\n    get: function (target: any, prop: string) {\r\n      if (prop === 'unwrap') {\r\n        return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\r\n          target.then((res: PostgrestResponse) => {\r\n            if (res.error) throw new Error(`SupabaseError: query failed: \\n${JSON.stringify(res.error)}`)\r\n            else return res.data\r\n          })\r\n        })\r\n      } else {\r\n        return target[prop]\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n  }\r\n  const supabase_proxy = new Proxy(supabase, supabase_proxy_handler)\r\n```\r\nThis technically works, but manipulating the types to include the `unwrap()` method is harder.\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n`unwrap` is a common pattern in several languages & libraries. Here is an example in rust: https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/error/option_unwrap.html\r\n",

For instance:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ntry {\r\n    const { data, error } = await supabase.from('table').select('*')\r\n    if (error) throw new Error(error)\r\n\r\n    // do other post-processing\r\n} catch (error) {\r\n    // handle the errors\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a short example, but it can get especially cumbersome when combining this with other API calls for other services. Here's a contrived example that should hopefully get the point across.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ntry {\r\n    const [{ data, error }, fetchResponse, otherApiResponse] = await Promise.all([\r\n        supabase.from('table').select('*'),\r\n        fetch('https://example.com/api-endpoint'),\r\n        someOtherApiFunctionCall(),\r\n    ])\r\n    if (error) throw new Error(error)\r\n\r\n    // do other post-processing\r\n} catch (error) {\r\n    // handle the errors\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice how the Supabase error is handled differently from everything else?\r\n\r\nOr what if you don't use async/await, and you use then/catch. For instance, inside of a react useEffect hook, then/catch is preferred since you cannot use async/await directly in hook.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst [posts, setPosts] = useState()\r\nconst [errorMessage, setErrorMessage] = useState('')\r\n\r\n// example with no error handling\r\nuseEffect(() => {\r\n    supabase\r\n        .from('posts')\r\n        .select('*')\r\n        .then(({ data }) => setPosts(data))\r\n}, [])\r\n\r\n// with error handling\r\nuseEffect(() => {\r\n    const getData = async () => {\r\n        const { data, error } = await supabase.from('posts').select('*')\r\n        if (error) setError(error)\r\n        else setPosts(data)\r\n    }\r\n    getData()\r\n}, [])\r\n\r\n// error handling if supabase unwrapped promises\r\nuseEffect(() => {\r\n    supabase\r\n        .from('posts')\r\n        .select('*')\r\n        .unwrap()\r\n        .then((data) => setPosts(data))\r\n        .catch((error) => setError(error))\r\n}, [])\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would argue that the unwrap option is the clearest option to read and write.\r\n\r\nI understand that this is a matter of opinion and not objective fact, but when a lot of JavaScript is built around being able to reject promises, I find it hard to believe that _not_ rejecting on errors is always better. At least having the option with `unwrap` I think is much better than the current schema.",

It does not happen when the grant_type is password, only when trying to use a provider login. The local storage session is properly set.\r\n\r\n## To Reproduce\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior, please provide code snippets or a repository:\r\n\r\n1. Go to https://github.com/Anstroy/alacena-vue-3.git\r\n2. Clone the repo and install dependencies and add supabase url and key \r\n3. Start repo using yarn serve\r\n4. Try logging in using a provider. \r\n5. Take a look at the console. The console.log within `services/supabase` login function should output the response, but you will see it outputs the response then suddenly swaps to null, due to what seems like a sudden page refresh. \r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nResponse from callback should return to the callback URL and a page refresh after the site has returned should not occur?\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\nWill work on getting screenshots.\r\n\r\n## System information\r\n\r\n- OS: Windows\r\n- Browser (if applies) Brave\r\n- Version of supabase-js: latest\r\n- Version of Node.js: 12.18.3\r\n",

How can this be resolved so the warnings don't occur?\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\nHaving searched a little, I found some notes referring to `this.__awaiter` as a Typescript helper for earlier ES versions that don't have async/await.  These lines seem to be from the GoTrue packages.  Might this have something to do with combining various ES versions in rollup?\r\n\r\nI also noticed that I don't get this problem when using snowpack and svelte, so this seems to be isolated to sapper or rollup.  \r\n\r\nThis is getting beyond my level of understanding of JS versions and build tools, but I thought it might be worth reporting here, since Sapper and Supabase are such complimentary combo. \r\n\r\n### System information\r\n\r\n- Manjaro Linux (Arch-based)\r\n- Node 15.6.0\r\n\r\npackage.json:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"svelte-app\",\r\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\r\n  \"scripts\": {\r\n    \"build\": \"rollup -c\",\r\n    \"dev\": \"rollup -c -w\",\r\n    \"start\": \"sirv public\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"devDependencies\": {\r\n    \"@rollup/plugin-commonjs\": \"^17.0.0\",\r\n    \"@rollup/plugin-json\": \"^4.1.0\",\r\n    \"@rollup/plugin-node-resolve\": \"^11.0.0\",\r\n    \"rollup\": \"^2.3.4\",\r\n    \"rollup-plugin-css-only\": \"^3.1.0\",\r\n    \"rollup-plugin-livereload\": \"^2.0.0\",\r\n    \"rollup-plugin-svelte\": \"^7.0.0\",\r\n    \"rollup-plugin-terser\": \"^7.0.0\",\r\n    \"svelte\": \"^3.0.0\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"@supabase/supabase-js\": \"^1.3.2\",\r\n    \"sirv-cli\": \"^1.0.0\"\r\n  }\r\n}```\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n",

It does load the session into localstorage, but doesn't let me handle the response from the call.\r\nSo I can't check for `user` or `errors` after calling `auth.signIn()`. The only thing I can do is put a function in `mounted` to check if `this.$supabase.auth.user()` exists after page refresh, and then I can `router.push` to a welcome page if so. But that obviously isn't desired behavior.\r\n\r\n## To Reproduce\r\n\r\nHere's the code for my sign in page.\r\n```\r\nexport default {\r\n  data: function () {\r\n    return {\r\n      //v-model to form inputs\r\n      form: {\r\n        email: '',\r\n        password: ''\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  methods: {\r\n    // called on form submit\r\n    async onSubmit () {\r\n      try {\r\n        const { error, session, user } = await this.$supabase.auth.signIn({\r\n          email: this.form.email,\r\n          password: this.form.password,\r\n        })\r\n        //none of the following code is called due to page refresh\r\n        if (error) {\r\n          console.error('Error thrown:', error.message)\r\n        }\r\n        if (user) {\r\n          console.log(user)\r\n        }\r\n      } catch (error) {\r\n        console.error('Error thrown:', error.message)\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  mounted: function () {\r\n    //check if supabase session exists\r\n    const user = this.$supabase.auth.user()\r\n    if (user) {\r\n      //save user data to vuex\r\n       this.$store.commit('LOG_IN', user)\r\n       //redirect to main page\r\n       this.$router.push('/')\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI expect `auth.signIn()` to not cause page refresh so that I can properly handle the response and possible errors.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n## System information\r\n\r\n- OS: WSL 2\r\n- Browser (if applies): Chrome/Edge\r\n- Version of supabase-js: 1.7.7\r\n- Version of Node.js: 14.15.4\r\n- Nuxt: 2.14.12\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\n",

It accepts 2 parameters - `search_value TEXT` and `result_limit INTEGER`. It returns a `TABLE`, and all returned fields and types are correctly defined.\r\n\r\nThis function uses the `SIMILARITY` function, as well as the distance (`<->`) operator, both from the `pg_trgm` extension. This extension shows as enabled in the dashboard.\r\n\r\nI have verified that results return correctly when running the following query from within pgAdmin as well as the Supabase dashboard:\r\n```SQL\r\nSELECT * FROM search_stations('Leeds', 10)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, when I do the following inside my codebase using supabase-js:\r\n```typescript\r\nawait SupabaseClient.rpc(\"search_stations\", {\r\n    search_value: \"Leeds\",\r\n    result_limit: 10\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following error occurs:\r\n```JSON\r\n{\r\n  \"error\": {\r\n    \"hint\": \"No function matches the given name and argument types. You might need to add explicit type casts.\",\r\n    \"details\": null,\r\n    \"code\": \"42883\",\r\n    \"message\": \"function similarity(text, text) does not exist\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"data\": null,\r\n  \"count\": null,\r\n  \"status\": 404,\r\n  \"statusText\": \"Not Found\",\r\n  \"body\": null\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am able to correctly call other stored functions in my database, but none of them utilize features from any extensions.\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe function should not throw an error and should instead return the results of the function.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n## System information\r\n\r\n- OS: Windows 10 X64\r\n- Browser (if applies): N/A - request running via Node (14.14.0)\r\n- Version of supabase-js: 1.7.7\r\n- Version of Node.js: 14.14.0\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\nI am able to correctly call other stored functions in my database and results are correctly returned, but none of those other functions utilize features from a extensions.\r\n\r\nI have tried explicitly setting `extensions.similarity` for all the calls to similarity inside my function, but this returns the following when run via `rpc()`:\r\n\r\n```JSON\r\n{\r\n  \"error\": {\r\n    \"hint\": null,\r\n    \"details\": null,\r\n    \"code\": \"42501\",\r\n    \"message\": \"permission denied for schema extensions\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"data\": null,\r\n  \"count\": null,\r\n  \"status\": 403,\r\n  \"statusText\": \"Forbidden\",\r\n  \"body\": null\r\n}\r\n```\r\n",

I've dropped my function, updated it to use the `extensions.similarity` call (from `similarity`), and then executed the query to add the function again. I then granted usage to anon and authenticated using the details in the link. I can see in pgAdmin that grantee's `anon` and `authenticated` have the `usage` privilege (`U`), both with a grantor of `postgres`. I have also checked the search path for the API, and it is defined as `public, extensions`.\r\n\r\nHowever, even after all that, running the same RPC call results in  403 (`permission denied for schema extensions`).\r\n\r\nThe link also mentions it won't happen for new projects - Would I need to spin up a completely new project in order for this to take effect?\r\n\r\nIf I grant usage to `service_role` (`grant usage on schema extensions to service_role;`), I am able to execute the function via `rpc()`. Are there any potential downsides or security concerns with doing this?",

            "body": "# Feature request\r\n\r\nTree-shaking is currently not possible with the supabase-js library because `SupabaseClient` is implemented using classes. Neither Webpack or Rollup supports tree-shaking class methods.\r\n\r\n## Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.\r\n\r\nSupabase bundle size is quite small compared to others (firebase, amplify), but it will only increase as more features are added. Projects that do not use all the features that Supabase provides will regardless pay the cost. Firebase has realized this with their new [Modular Javascript SDK](https://modularfirebase.web.app/get-started/why-change/).\r\n\r\n## Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nInstead of initializing a single Supabase client, here's a modular API proposal:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// initSupabase.js\r\nconst supabaseClient = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseKey);\r\n// Does not automatically instantiate RealtimeClient, PostgrestClient, etc.\r\n// Features can be opted in as such:\r\nexport const db = getPostgrest(supabaseClient);\r\nexport const realtime = getRealtime(supabaseClient);\r\nexport const auth = getAuth(supabaseClient);\r\nexport const storage = getStorage(supabaseClient);\r\n```\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// some-random-component.js\r\nimport { db, realtime } from './initSupabase';\r\n\r\nconst { data, error } = await db\r\n  .from('cities')\r\n  .select()\r\n\r\nconst mySubscription = realtime\r\n  .from('*')\r\n  .on('*', payload => {\r\n    console.log('Change received!', payload)\r\n  })\r\n  .subscribe()\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile this won't eliminate every piece of unused code, it's a start to enabling opt-in for specific features.\r\n\r\n## Caveats\r\n\r\n- Will break the current stable API, but can be remedied w/ codemods.\r\n- Not sure if `SupabaseAuthClient` can be separated as all other modules rely on that\r\n\r\nIf this is something you guys think is worth pursuing, I'd be happy to start working on a PR!",

Most frameworks already polyfill, its supported in all major browsers and even Node JS at this point. Most React libraries already target ES6 only and tell users to polyfill.

That's why you need `noExternal` to include all node dependencies otherwise you get errors during deployment. This causes dev mode to break, so only add node deps to `noExternal` when process.env.NODE_ENV = \"production.\r\n\r\n2. Vite creates two bundles, a server bundle \"functions/node/render/server/app.mjs\" and a client bundle \"static/_app/*\". The problem is that it only reads dependencies once:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/344d77e9735bc907b9383ad729afb0a8daa2af5f/packages/vite/src/node/plugins/resolve.ts#L466\r\n\r\nFirst off, `cross-fetch` always resolves to the browser entry point. The way the entry point is resolved does not take into account whether the bundler is in SSR mode or not. \r\n\r\n3. But even if it did resolve correctly, Vite only does one pass over each dependency and then caches it. You can't have the same package resolve to a different entry point for SSR unless you remove `resolvedImports['.']` or flush it between each phase.\r\n\r\nSo my hacky workaround at the moment is to force disable the browser entry point during SSR module generation, and to disable module caching.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31086926/115141701-1f393400-a081-11eb-81cb-940af06a598d.png)\r\n\r\nThis will need to be fixed by Vite.",

For Cloudflare Workers specifically, there is no `global` or `window` object like you'd have in other runtimes, but you do have `self`, so:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst supabase = createClient('...', '...', {fetch: fetch.bind(self)})\r\n```\r\n\r\nReally the example I added to the README should have probably been `{ fetch: customFetch }` to avoid confusion, I can look at opening a few more PRs. \ud83d\ude42 ",

Deno Deploy only has a subset of the Deno CLI since it's meant to run in an idempotent serverless environment (at least that's my understanding).\r\n\r\nThe first show-stopper has to to with `XMLHttpRequest`, which isn't present in Deno, and seems like this would be addressed if #154 is fixed.\r\n\r\nOnce I tried a workaround to ignore the XMLHttpRequest keyword, I got an error from GoTrue saying that `getItem is not defined`, probably referring to `localStorage` which Deno also doesn't support.

Initialize a supabase client, passing in custom headers for the client, e.g.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'\r\n\r\nconst supabase = createClient(url, anonKey, {\r\n  headers: {\r\n    apiKey: anonKey,\r\n    Authorization: `Bearer ${jwt}`\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Make a request using that client, e.g.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst result = await supabase.storage.from('avatars').download(avatarURL)\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Observe that the request does not return the expected result, as the request made by the client does not use the `Authorization` header that was provided on creation\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nSupabase client uses the headers provided in the call to `createClient` when making requests.\r\n\r\nIn the example above this would set the `Authorization` header on the request to the Storage API, allowing the server to make a request to the restricted content on behalf of the user.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n## System information\r\n\r\n- OS: N/A\r\n- Browser: N/A\r\n- Version of supabase-js: 1.11.9\r\n- Version of Node.js: 14.16.1\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\nThis issue was created off the back of [this comment](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/discussions/1094#discussioncomment-688755), and is discussed further in that thread.\r\n",

In particular I was working on a feature to allow users to create a \"profile\", where they could enter some basic information and upload an avatar (hence the use of the storage client).\r\n\r\nI decided to use a server-side API call to fetch the user's avatar, because this would allow me to simplify the markup and just render an `<img>` tag with the `src` attribute set to the API route. Plus I could then make adjustments to the image on the server-side before sending the response if I ever wanted.\r\n\r\nFrom memory, the issue was that `_getAuthHeaders` was only reading the session (`this.auth.session()`) to get the access token, so when this code was executed on the server-side the session would not be available, and requests would therefore always be unauthenticated.\r\n\r\nIt looks like this code may have changed since, and [this comment](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/discussions/1094#discussioncomment-714633) seems to suggest that there is a way to achieve authenticated server-side requests, but I guess initializing the Supabase client with custom headers still does not work as expected in the issue description.\r\n\r\nI hope this was useful for you, thanks",

Please describe.\r\n\r\nWould like to access the [`PostgrestResponse`](https://github.com/supabase/postgrest-js/blob/master/src/lib/types.ts#L38) and [`PostgrestError`](https://github.com/supabase/postgrest-js/blob/master/src/lib/types.ts#L8) types to allow for verbose typing within end application. \r\n\r\nThe `await supabase.from(TABLE).select()` (and similar) commands return a destructured [`PostgrestResponse`](https://github.com/supabase/postgrest-js/blob/master/src/lib/types.ts#L38)  object.\r\n\r\nThere is no way to access this typing that I can see, either directly or indirectly _(ie via the terminal [`@supabase/postgrest-js`](https://github.com/supabase/postgrest-js/blob/master/src/index.ts#L4) package index)_ which disallows the possibility of verbose typing, which is required by [`@typescript-eslint/typedef`](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/blob/master/packages/eslint-plugin/docs/rules/typedef.md)\r\n\r\n### Related error\r\n```text\r\nTS2694: Namespace '\"/frontend/node_modules/.pnpm/@supabase+supabase-js@1.11.10/node_modules/@supabase/supabase-js/dist/main/index\"' has no exported member 'PostgrestResponse'.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\n(Re)export the `PostgrestResponse` type from https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js/blob/master/src/index.ts\r\n\r\nGiven the `@supabase/postgrest-js` package [is tightly coupled](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js/blob/master/package.json#L40) with `@supabase/supabase-js`, it seems architecturally ok to export from the main package to avoid developers having to import `@supabase/postgrest-js` directly _(which is likely to end up out of sync with the underlying versioning, and in any case is not currently possible anyway)_).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nCurrently, I am creating a local copy of the type, although naturally, this is not desirable long term for obvious reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Suggested implementation\r\n\r\n1. https://github.com/supabase/postgrest-js/blob/master/src/index.ts\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport PostgrestClient from './PostgrestClient'\r\nimport PostgrestFilterBuilder from './lib/PostgrestFilterBuilder'\r\nimport PostgrestQueryBuilder from './lib/PostgrestQueryBuilder'\r\nimport { PostgrestBuilder, PostgrestResponse, PostgrestError } from './lib/types'\r\n\r\nexport { PostgrestClient, PostgrestFilterBuilder, PostgrestQueryBuilder, PostgrestBuilder, PostgrestResponse, PostgrestError }\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js/blob/master/src/index.ts\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n\r\nimport SupabaseClient from './SupabaseClient'\r\nimport { SupabaseClientOptions, SupabaseRealtimePayload } from './lib/types'\r\nimport { PostgrestResponse, PostgrestError } from '@subabase/postgrest-js'\r\nimport { User as AuthUser, Session as AuthSession } from '@supabase/gotrue-js'\r\nexport * from '@supabase/gotrue-js'\r\nexport * from '@supabase/realtime-js'\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * Creates a new Supabase Client.\r\n */\r\nconst createClient = (\r\n  supabaseUrl: string,\r\n  supabaseKey: string,\r\n  options?: SupabaseClientOptions\r\n) => {\r\n  return new SupabaseClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseKey, options)\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport {\r\n  createClient,\r\n  SupabaseClient,\r\n  SupabaseClientOptions,\r\n  SupabaseRealtimePayload,\r\n  AuthUser,\r\n  AuthSession,\r\n  PostgrestResponse, \r\n  PostgrestError\r\n}\r\n```\r\n \r\n",

The app does not crash meaning no major errors are being thrown. Apart from this I have no way of debugging the issue as the release variant scarcely logs anything. \r\n\r\n## To Reproduce\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst { data, error } = await supabase\r\n      .from('table')\r\n      .select('*')\r\n      .eq('column', variableToMatch);\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe expected behaviour is that the call will return the requested data from the Supabase table or an error suggesting that something went wrong.\r\n\r\n## System information\r\n\r\n- OS: macOS\r\n- Version of supabase-js: v1.11.12\r\n- Version of Node.js: v14.16.0\r\n- Version of Async Storage: v1.15.4\r\n- Version of Expo: v41.0.0\r\n- Version of React Native: v0.63.4\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\nI have been getting these logs: `Error getting session from URL.`, `nw_socket_handle_socket_event [C5:1] Socket SO_ERROR [61: Connection refused]`, `nw_connection_get_connected_socket [C5] Client called nw_connection_get_connected_socket on unconnected nw_connection`, `TCP Conn 0x2806304d0 Failed : error 0:61 [61]`, `SocketRocket: In debug mode. Allowing connection to any root cert` but I am uncertain whether the last four pertain to Supabase. Happens on both Android and iOS.\r\n",

Please describe.\r\n\r\nI'm constantly needing to log back into my app, even though I've set the expiration date to be a week long and have `autoRefreshToken` set to true. It seems like I need to re-enter my credentials even if the token is not actually expired (i.e. I need to re-enter my credentials even though a week has not passed since the last time I did it). This happens both on localhost and on my production website. The expiration date also doesn't matter, I've set it to be either the minimum or the maximum and the same behavior occurs.\r\n\r\nIf `autoRefreshToken` is true, I would expect the token to be automatically refreshed without needing to enter my credentials again. In other words, if I've logged in once, I should stay logged in unless I've explicitly logged out or cleared my cookies/cache.\r\n\r\nBasically what I'm looking for is something that works equivalently to a \"Stay signed in\" checkbox that's present on most websites, which is AFAIK not possible with Supabase at the moment. You don't need to log in to GitHub/Twitter/YouTube every day you open the website, which is unfortunately pretty much the experience I have with Supabase Auth right now.\r\n\r\n## Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nIf I've logged in once, I should stay logged in unless I've explicitly logged out or cleared my cookies/cache. This means no 401 errors, and no prompting to log in.\r\n\r\nIdeally, the auto-refreshing of the token would actually function completely offline. So if the app is a PWA and you've already signed in online once, then you should still be authenticated if you visit the app again when you're offline.\r\n\r\nThis \"stay signed in\" option could be a separate opt-in parameter. But most likely, if `autoRefreshToken` is true, then most people would expect that this is the behavior that happens (that's certainly my assumption).\r\n\r\n## Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nNo way to do this in Supabase AFAIK.\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\nPotentially fixing https://github.com/supabase/gotrue-js/issues/403 might fix this issue as well.\r\n",

Please describe.\r\n\r\nCurrently, for some reason email/password auth requires the user to have verified their email address for a session to be created. This is extremely frustrating, because in most cases you would add additional user data excluding just the email and password of the user and because I don't do any inserts on the client and only at a server-level I have to send the user's token to the backend, but because the session is null I don't have a token to send.\r\n\r\nFor some reason when you disable email confirmation on the dashboard, the user is automatically verified despite the docs talking about email verification like this:\r\n\r\n\"If \"Email Confirmations\" is turned off, both a user and a session will be returned\", aka it does not say anything about the email being automatically verified.\r\n\r\nRedirecting the user to a page where they can add in the additional user data is not ideal due to various UX concerns.\r\n\r\n## Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nIf email verification is optional, the email shouldn't be automatically verified. It should just be unverified, and a session should be created.\r\n\r\nIn fact I would expect disabling email verification to not just automatically consider it verified, I would expect it to be unverified so I can use `generateLink()` to send a verification email.\r\n\r\n## Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nTried turning off email verification, but it just automatically verifies the email.\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n",

It looks like the object with `count` [does not get passed](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js/blob/master/src/SupabaseClient.ts#L99-L102) to `postgrest.js` from `supabase.js` as this is the current function definition:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n  rpc<T = any>(fn: string, params?: object) {\r\n    const rest = this._initPostgRESTClient()\r\n    return rest.rpc<T>(fn, params)\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently, the [following example](https://supabase.io/docs/reference/javascript/rpc#with-count-option) mentioned in the documentation would not work.

Local storage keys unrelated to Supabase are unchanged and remain persisted, leading me to believe that this is a Supabase issue.\r\n\r\n## To Reproduce\r\n\r\nI'm not entirely sure how to reproduce this. It happens consistently for me, but I don't know the cause. Usually, after logging in and waiting for a few days, the local storage entry gets cleared automatically.\r\n\r\nYou can try the following:\r\n\r\n1. Implement client-side Supabase Auth\r\n2. Log into the application\r\n3. Wait some period of time (usually 1-2 days)\r\n4. Observe that you are logged out and the local storage entry has been cleared\r\n\r\nFor details on how I am implementing Supabase Auth, take a look at my [public repository](https://github.com/churichard/notabase/blob/main/utils/useAuth.tsx).\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\n`supabase.auth.token` should never be cleared unless the user explicitly logs out or clears their cache.\r\n\r\n## System information\r\n\r\nThis happens on multiple OS's and browsers.\r\n\r\n- OS: Windows, Android, iOS\r\n- Browser (if applies): Chrome, Safari\r\n- Version of supabase-js: 1.22.5\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\nMy JWT expiry is `604800`, but I've also used `60` before with the same behavior happening. It seems to be unaffected by the JWT expiry value.\r\n\r\nThis happens both on `localhost` and in production.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure about the implementation details of Supabase Auth, but what could be happening is that the `refreshToken` that I am passing into the `signIn` method is expired, so the user gets automatically logged out and the local storage entry is cleared. What should happen is that the token is automatically refreshed, the user stays signed in, and the local storage entry is preserved/updated.\r\n\r\n**Edit: I've noticed this happening sometimes after I deploy.** Is there something that changes after each deployment that invalidates the session? I'm using Vercel.",

Does Supabase automatically restore expired sessions somehow (like on the next network request, or does it coincide with the every 3600 seconds for the refresh token)? I recall getting 401 errors when making requests sometimes before I switched to my current implementation, but maybe that's been fixed now.\r\n\r\nIn my audit log, it seems like every time I refresh or use the app, there is a `token_refreshed` and `token_revoked` action happening.

Rate limited logins would be the correct process for this, but it's also difficult to defend against some forms of attack unless they are targeting one specific account, in which case locking that account from logging in for a duration or until an account owner performs some verification process.\r\n\r\nIf an attacker is aiming to test as many accounts as possible, then the options are either cookies (easily defeated) or IP blocking (also easily defeated). There's some hybrid options out there such as behaviour analysis, but they have their own set of limitations and potential for false positives.\r\n\r\nRate-limiting registration isn't feasible to introduce as an attacker could easily bombard the system with fake registrations and block legitimate users from registering. For ecommerce sites, this would potentially make it a haven for scalpers. At the same time, it becomes difficult for developers when they're unsure if an account exists during registration.\r\n\r\nWhat most online services have is a generic truthy response during the account recovery process. For example, instead of saying \"An email was sent to the account we found\", they'll instead say \"If an account with this email exists, we have sent an email to it\". I believe rate limiting per account already exists for this in Supabase.\r\n\r\nIt's a difficult problem to solve because there's potential for hackers to use the sign up process to ascertain if an account exists (as opposed to testing login), but developers want to know if an account exists when a user is registering.",

There should be a straight forward api available for server to server calls so that developers can decide what the proper pattern would be for themselves based on their own needs. The current Supabase position is to create an associated \"user profile\" table inside supabase in order to recreate missing functionality (such as basic checks to see if a user exists). The more of these types of work arounds a developer needs to create, the less compelling supabase becomes over say a vanilla postgres + hasura instance.

As long as we don't leak any info about whether a user account exists or not on any public endpoint, then the information is secure (at least as far as this specific issue is concerned).\r\n\r\nThe correct solution here is to take this one step further: If a user tries to sign up who already has an existing account, we still return a \"check your inbox for confirmation email\" message, but we instead send them an account recovery email (which is actually just a magic link) then the developer can decide whether to direct them to a password reset page or just allow them to go about their session as normal.\r\n\r\nThis solves for:\r\n- UX concerns (a user who has forgotten that they have an account and is expecting a confirmation email, will receive an account recovery email - note: the developer can edit the template in supabase dashboard)\r\n- DX concerns (there should be no extra call required to detect account existence and trigger account recovery)\r\n- Security (the presence of an account is never revealed on any public endpoint)\r\n\r\nAn important reason for why we decided to be \"secure by default\" on issues like this, is partly because of the number of users adopting our auth service. I could fairly easily take your email address, make a sign-up request to every known supabase endpoint on the internet, building up a map of all the various services that you are/are-not subscribed to. Which is quite a large privacy concern.\r\n\r\nI propose that we do several things:\r\n- Document the response behavior clearly [in the docs](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/tree/master/web)\r\n- Update our [auth examples](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/tree/master/examples) to exhibit the up to date auth flow\r\n- Update gotrue to [send a recovery email on repeat sign up attempt ](https://github.com/supabase/gotrue/issues/286)\r\n\r\nAs always any help on these ones would be hugely appreciated.

If a user has logged out, to prevent them from being confused on the same browser store some information in local storage that you can use to give them a \"welcome back\" screen indicating the correct sign-in method they can use.\r\n2. If masking is less important for your application you can create an edge function which you can use to indicate to your users what type of account they have and what may be going on. You can use the information in the `auth.users` and `auth.identities` tables to derive some conclusions in those cases.",

The user has already confirmed their email address.

Yes, this means that supabase would still need to have some mechanism to prevent leakage of the existence of an email if the system is to have a functionality like \"Forget username? send it to email...\" but I imagine that protection against such a leakage would be easy to implement by always responding in a constant time.\r\n\r\nI noticed that someone asked for this feature https://github.com/supabase/gotrue/issues/903 a while ago but it was closed.

This makes it harder to track issues across the various separate repositories. Issues which are fixed in one of the constituent repositories also require an explicit version bump in the `supabase-js` repository, which adds another layer of indirection for new users.\r\n\r\nGiven that most Supabase users tend to just use the main `supabase-js` client which is also highlighted in the docs, I'd propose converting `supabase-js` into a monorepo which contains all the separate clients. Additionally, this might also ease the transition into using a more tree-shaking friendly approach as planned for 2.0 releases (#170).",

(We do bump the version in supabase-js anyway, though it's kinda redundant.)\r\n\r\nOther concerns are valid - difficulty to track issues, tree-shaking.

I didn't see any improves in workflow and versioning was scaring to me.\r\n\r\nBut I started a project myself with `lerna` and later changed opinion.\r\n\r\nIn my little experience I can tell that monorepos are powerful and versioning is wonderful. Not all projects are eligible to be developed in a monorepo but this project it is.\r\n\r\nReasons:\r\nIn JS ecosystem is difficult to update indirect dependencies, we all know. So in supabase-js all other repos are direct dependencies and so indirect dependencies in all projects using supabase-js. But supabase-js dependencies are specified with a range and so not always updated correctly. And tracking issues and updates are difficult as mentioned above.\r\nVersioning might be overwhelmed and unnecessary sometimes but helps a lot with updating indirect dependencies.\r\nOverall I think monorepo could be considered.\r\n",

                    "id": "IC_kwDOD79Crs46e3od",
                    "body": "So i did a bit of investigating and here's what I was able to come up with. When using the [`auth.api.createUser`](https://github.com/supabase/gotrue-js/blob/master/src/GoTrueApi.ts#L43), it calls the [`gotrue`](https://github.com/supabase/gotrue) api, specifically the `admin/users` POST endpoint. \r\n\r\nThis in turn calls the [`adminUserCreate`(https://github.com/supabase/gotrue/blob/master/api/admin.go#L176) method which does a number of things. What's important in regards to this issue is that it:\r\n\r\n- grabs the params [here](https://github.com/supabase/gotrue/blob/master/api/admin.go#L182)\r\n- grabs the config [here](https://github.com/supabase/gotrue/blob/master/api/admin.go#L178)\r\n\r\nNow after the new user is written to the table, there are a number of checks. One of which is:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nif params.EmailConfirm {\r\n\tif terr := user.Confirm(tx); terr != nil {\r\n\t\treturn terr\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI beleive this is where the issue exists. `params.EmailConfirm` will always be null. When we grab the params mentioned above, what's happening is that we decode the request body. But the request body only allows `UserAttributes` defined as such:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport interface UserAttributes {\r\n  /**\r\n   * The user's email.\r\n   */\r\n  email?: string\r\n  /**\r\n   * The user's password.\r\n   */\r\n  password?: string\r\n  /**\r\n   * An email change token.\r\n   */\r\n  email_change_token?: string\r\n\r\n  /**\r\n   * A custom data object. Can be any JSON.\r\n   */\r\n  data?: object\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne solution is to add a check against the config we grab if AutoConfirm is enabled. This is reflective of the behavior of the [`auth.signUp`](https://github.com/supabase/gotrue-js/blob/master/src/GoTrueClient.ts#L123) API which ultimately calls the `signup` POST endpoint on the gotrue server.\r\n\r\nAfter a user is created with the `signup` endpoint, there are checks against the config on to whether or not the user should be confirmed. This can be seen [here](https://github.com/supabase/gotrue/blob/master/api/signup.go#L114):\r\n\r\n```go\r\nif params.Provider == \"email\" && !user.IsConfirmed() {\r\n\tif config.Mailer.Autoconfirm {\r\n\t\tif terr = models.NewAuditLogEntry(tx, instanceID, user, models.UserSignedUpAction, nil); terr != nil {\r\n\t\t\treturn terr\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\tif terr = triggerEventHooks(ctx, tx, SignupEvent, user, instanceID, config); terr != nil {\r\n\t\t\treturn terr\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\tif terr = user.Confirm(tx); terr != nil {\r\n\t\t\treturn internalServerError(\"Database error updating user\").WithInternalError(terr)\r\n\t\t}\r\n        ....\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf this appears to be the right path, I'm happy to stab at creating a PR!",

Subscription configuration:**\r\n```typescript\r\nsupabase\r\n    .from('*')\r\n    .on('*', (payload) => {\r\n      console.log(`${payload.eventType} received: `, payload);\r\n    })\r\n    .subscribe();\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\nWhen I perform an `INSERT` or `UPDATE` on entities (such as `board_lists` table or `board_cards` table), I expect to see the following logged:\r\n\r\n```\r\nINSERT received: {payload data}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, I **do not** see any realtime event **except** for `DELETE` operations, which are behaving as expected.\r\n\r\nI am able to correctly perform `INSERT`, `UPDATE` and `READ` events on the client via the Supabase client/REST API, so I know that the RLS policies are not preventing the user from performing these operations.\r\n\r\n## System / versions\r\n* MacOS latest\r\n* Node @ v17.2.0\r\n* Yarn @ 1.22.17\r\n* @supabase/supabase-js@1.29.0\r\n* @supabase/realtime-js@^1.3.3\r\n* @supabase/gotrue-js@^1.21.7\r\n* @supabase/postgrest-js@^0.35.0",

Launch your application with something like Live Server, or vite.\r\n    1.1 This sould return something like ``` Serving at http://localhost:3000 ```\r\n2. Create an account and download (ngrok)[https://ngrok.com/]\r\n    2.2 Follow the instruction\r\n    2.3 Open a tunnel to your localhost with ```path-to-ngrok/ngrok http 3000 ``` or the port that serve your app\r\n3. Create a (supabase)[https://app.supabase.io] account, and follow the (instructions)[https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-twitter] to enable ```Twitter Authorization```\r\n4. Setup (Oauth authorization)[https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/projects/xxx/apps/xxx/auth-settings] on your app in Twitter Developer\r\n    4.1 Use ``` https://xxx.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback ``` as Callback URI / Redirect URL\r\n    4.2 USe ``` https://xxxx-xx-xxx-xxx-xxx.ngrok.io/ ``` as  Website URL\r\n5. Test your application at ``` https://xxxx-xx-xxx-xxx-xxx.ngrok.io/ ``` \r\n\r\n## Important notice\r\nIf you close your ngrok session. You need to re-start your ```Local Server``` and ```Ngrok Server``` re-do point 4.2, 5 and re-set supabase Website URL on [authorization settings tab](https://app.supabase.io/project/xxx/auth/settings)",

Also, there don't seem to be any error message in the response to debug or to know what exactly is causing the issue.\r\n\r\nIs there a way in `@supabase/supabase-js` to get the error object on subscription?\r\n\r\nI have tried `try catch` but the error is not going to `catch` block.\r\n\r\nAlso, I've tried `.onError()`, which is indeed running the callback function, but it doesn't have access to error object.\r\n\r\nThe callback on `.subscribe()` is running *sometimes*, but simultaneously, the error is also running. But most of the time, only the error is occurring.\r\n\r\n## To Reproduce\r\n\r\nJust copy this code, and try it yourself.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst supabase = createClient(\r\n    'SUPABASE URL HERE',\r\n    'SUPABASE ANON KEY HERE'\r\n);\r\n\r\nsupabase\r\n    .from('*')\r\n    .on('*', (payload) => {\r\n        console.log('payload', payload);\r\n    })\r\n    .subscribe();\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've tried for all tables (`from('*')`) as well as individual tables (`from('messages')`).\r\nI've tried for all events (`on('*')`) as well as specific events (`on('INSERT')`)\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe realtime subscription should work as expected, whenever `INSERT`, `UPDATE` or `DELETE` events happen in any table, it should run the callback and log the output to screen.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69994239/154793399-5a8ab2d1-d120-408e-85bd-e3b0095f2f95.png)\r\n\r\n## System information\r\n\r\n- OS: Windows Subsystem for Linux (Ubuntu) on Windows 10\r\n- Browser: Firefox, Chrome, Brave\r\n- Version of supabase-js: `1.30.3`\r\n- Version of Node.js: `16.13.1`",

            "body": "# Chore\r\n\r\n## Describe the chore\r\n\r\nCurrently, the ```app_metadata``` and ```user_metadata``` fields of the ```User``` interface are defined as anonymous types like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n app_metadata: {\r\n    provider?: string\r\n    [key: string]: any\r\n  }\r\n  user_metadata: {\r\n    [key: string]: any\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese fields often contain app specific data and each app has different expectations of what this data might contain. Hence, each app can provide its own types for each of these fields by using TypeScripts declaration merging (https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-merging.html).\r\n\r\nHowever, declaration merging is ONLY possible for named interface types - NOT for anonymous types, like the ones currently used.\r\n\r\nThe necessary change to support this scenario is simple and backwards compatible. Here is what the proposed change might look like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// In gotrue-js/types.ts\r\nexport interface AppMetadata {\r\n    provider?: string\r\n    [key: string]: any\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport interface UserMetadata {\r\n    [key: string]: any\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport interface User {\r\n  id: string\r\n  app_metadata: AppMetadata\r\n  user_metadata: UserMetadata\r\n  aud: string\r\n...\r\n}\r\n\r\n// In myapp.ts\r\ndeclare module '@supabase/gotrue-js' {\r\n  interface UserMetadata {\r\n    myField?: number;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nsupabaseClient.auth.user()?.user_metadata.myField --> TS type checker and linters now know about myFIeld\r\n```",

This is in contrast to Firebase which provides all of this out of the box. \r\n\r\n## Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nBake caching into `supabase-js` so it's performant and robust by default, ideally with optimistic mutation support as well\r\n\r\n## Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nBYO querying layer that supports caching and eager mutations, like [react-query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/). Adds an extra layer of abstraction and complexity onto the client.\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n",

Something like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nsupabase.withFetch(fetch).from('mytable').select();\r\n```\r\n\r\nFull example:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script context=\"module\">\r\n  export const prerender = true;\r\n  import { supabase } from \"$lib/initSupabase\";\r\n\r\n  export async function load({ params, fetch, session, stuff }) {\r\n    let { data, error } = await supabase.from(\"users\").select();\r\n\r\n    if (error) {\r\n      return {\r\n        status: 500,\r\n      };\r\n    } else {\r\n      return {\r\n        props: {\r\n          users: data,\r\n        },\r\n      };\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nMaybe I'm overthinking this. The way I've solved this so far is by creating a function:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport const getSupabase = (fetch) => createClient(url, anonKey, { fetch });\r\n```\r\n\r\nI then use it in my `load` function.\r\n\r\nIs there a downside in creating multiple clients like this?

I created a client factory, similar to OP, where each request to the SDK would create a new client.  I did this so I could inject dynamic headers and settings into the client for each execution.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst supa = (...params) => createClient(...params);\r\n\r\nsupa().from...\r\nsupa().auth...\r\n// etc\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe issue I found was that auth listeners/events are registered to a specific client instance, not to the auth events themselves.  I'm not sure if this is intended or not.\r\n\r\nSo in my example above, if I do this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst supa = () => createClient(...);\r\n\r\nsupa().auth.onAuthStateChange((event, session) => {\r\n  if (event === 'SIGNED_OUT') {\r\n    console.log('Auth Event', event);\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n\r\nsupa().auth.signOut();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe listener is never called, presumably because I signed out from a different client instance.

Create a DB table\r\n\r\n```\r\ncreate table \"cities\" (\r\n  id integer,\r\n  population integer,\r\n)\r\n```\r\n2. Populate it with 1000 entries (it's important to have many entries). `ID` values go from 1 to 1001 and `population` value on all entries should be 0. So the result will be something like this:\r\n\r\n| id | population |  \r\n|----|------------|\r\n| 1  | 0          |  \r\n| 2  | 0          |  \r\n| 3  | 0          |   \r\n| ... | ...         |   \r\n| 1001 | 0         |   \r\n\r\n3.

Different order! \r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe order is the same. \r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\nThe issue can be reproduced in Supabase GUI as well by tweaking the visible Rows amount.

In other OAuth authentication flows with other (non-supabase) applications, you can sign in and out with different users, and be shown a prompt to authenticate each time. It is not possible to authenticate with different users in the same browser session using supabase OAuth authentication.\r\n\r\n## To Reproduce\r\n\r\nThis has been the same on all supabase examples I could find (including Teta https://teta.so/ & Supabase.com itself), and using different OAuth profiles (I have validated this using the Google OAuth flow but it also happens for the GitHub OAuth flow too)\r\n\r\n1. Go to supabase.com\r\n2. Sign in using any github profile by clicking \"Sign In With Github\"\r\n3. Click logout on the far left hand menu.\r\n4. Attempt to log in with a different github profile by clicking \"Sign In With Github\"\r\n5. See that you are logged in to supabase with the first profile you used\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nYou can log in and out n times with different profiles and you are shown the modal to select what user you'd like to log in with when you click \"Sign In With Github\" or \"Sign in with Google\" in different implementations. I can imagine there may be a nicer workflow whereby you do not need to log in with a user each time (for expedience and a smooth user experience), however I think there should be the option to allow re-authentication when a user clicks signout.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\n## System information\r\n\r\n- OS: macOS\r\n- Browser (if applies) Chrome 101.0.4951.54\r\n- Version of supabase-js: Whatever is running on supabase.com as of 31st May 2022 0752 UTC\r\n- Version of Node.js: Whatever is running behind supabase.com as of 31st May 2022 0752 UTC\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\n-\r\n",

Here is a look at the stack trace. \r\n\r\n## To Reproduce\r\n\r\nUpgrade to NextJS 12.1.6 and try to use @supabase/supabase-js lib within a middleware function.\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\n```\r\nModule not found: Can't resolve 'fs'\r\n\r\nImport trace for requested module:\r\n./node_modules/bufferutil/index.js\r\n./node_modules/websocket/lib/WebSocketFrame.js\r\n./node_modules/websocket/lib/websocket.js\r\n./node_modules/websocket/index.js\r\n./node_modules/@supabase/realtime-js/dist/module/RealtimeClient.js\r\n./node_modules/@supabase/realtime-js/dist/module/index.js\r\n./node_modules/@supabase/supabase-js/dist/module/index.js\r\n./pages/api/v0/_middleware.ts\r\n\r\nhttps://nextjs.org/docs/messages/module-not-found\r\n\r\nYou're using a Node.js module (fs) which is not supported in the Edge Runtime.\r\nLearn more: https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/edge-runtime\r\n```\r\n",

                    "body": "Yeah, I'm using it to sync with an external auth provider. I need to sync the custom supabase auth key every 30 minutes since it regenerates. Previously, I was using `supabase.auth.setAuth(token)` similar to the [process described here](https://clerk.dev/docs/integration/supabase#configure-your-client). Since supabase v2 has removed setAuth, I've been considering the alternatives and this has been my favorite, other than the issue above with init.headers not getting passed through.\r\n\r\nI looked into the suggestion in [the removal PR](https://github.com/supabase/gotrue-js/pull/340) to pass the custom header into `createClient()`, but since the authentication token refreshes I can't just set it once. Also the call to get the first token is async, so that makes it tricky to export. I guess the other option is to recreate the client for every request, but that doesn't seem as clean/efficient as injecting your headers via the custom fetch?\r\n\r\n>That's odd - it should have headers populated, incl. auth headers and Accept. Does it work if you don't pass a custom fetch?\r\n\r\nIt does work fine without the custom fetch. I tried to [create a minimal reproduction here](https://stackblitz.com/edit/nextjs-8wfisu?file=pages%2F_app.js,package.json,supabase-service.js,pages%2Findex.js) (single table `todos` with two items, id's 1 and 2) and discovered that it does in fact pass an empty header into the custom fetch call. However, if I *just* pass both properties back to `fetch` without any other modification, in the network tab, all headers are set properly. If I try to set a custom header that supabase has already set (such as the one I need, `Authorization`), supabase seems to automatically overwrite it to the default (which is the `anon` key). The only way for me to get my custom `Authorization` header set is to completely overwrite the `headers` object with my own, in which case I need to manually reconstruct the appropriate headers since we aren't getting passed them in the custom fetch call, and for the `.single()` call, we can't know whether it was called with single in the custom fetch.",

I have a subscription that is definitely working as I can see the WS connection and incoming payload in the Chrome network tab, however my logic contained within the event callback is never fired. I'll include some code snippets below:\r\n\r\nHere is my mutation logic:\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\nconst add: MessageStorage[\"add\"] = async (messageNew) => {\r\n  const { data, error } = await client\r\n    .from<Message>(\"messages\")\r\n    .insert(messageNew)\r\n    .single()\r\n  if (!data) throw new Error(error.message)\r\n  return data\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport function useAddMessage() {\r\n  const {\r\n    mutate: addMessage,\r\n    isLoading,\r\n    error,\r\n  } = useMutation<Message, unknown, Omit<Message, \"id\" | \"createdAt\">>(\r\n    (partialMessage) => messageStorage.add(partialMessage),\r\n  )\r\n  return { addMessage, isLoading, error }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is my subscription:\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\nexport function useMessagesSubscription() {\r\n  const queryClient = useQueryClient()\r\n\r\n  const onEventChange = useCallback(\r\n    (message: SupabaseRealtimePayload<Message>) => {\r\n      console.log(message)\r\n\r\n      queryClient.setQueryData<Message[]>(MessageQueryKeys.getAll, (prev = []) => [\r\n        ...prev,\r\n        message.new,\r\n      ])\r\n    },\r\n    [queryClient],\r\n  )\r\n\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    const subscription = client\r\n      .from<Message>(\"messages\")\r\n      .on(\"INSERT\", onEventChange)\r\n      .subscribe()\r\n\r\n    return () => {\r\n      client.removeSubscription(subscription)\r\n    }\r\n  }, [queryClient, onEventChange])\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## To Reproduce\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior, please provide code snippets or a repository:\r\n\r\nThis repo is unfortunately private so recreating is understandably annoying but might be achieved via the following:\r\n\r\n1. Create a react app with create-react-app and v18\r\n2. `npm i react-query @supabase/supabase-js @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion`\r\n3. Make sure you are running the latest stable release of supabase-js (v1.36.5)\r\n4. Create a Supabase project\r\n5. Add a table\r\n6. Enable realtime `Database -> Replication -> Turn on realtime for the given table.`\r\n7. Follow the steps for creating a Supabase client.\r\n8. Copy and paste the above useEffect and replace table name with your table. \r\n9. Listen to \"INSERT\" events\r\n10. See if the callback is invoked after adding a row via the Supabase GUI.\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI would expect that when a new message is added that the callback within the .on() method would be invoked. Am I totally crazy, is this just a me problem? I've scoured the web only to find many people with the exact same solutions but not encountering the same problem.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46500734/187945199-08ac76c0-eca0-4514-b996-1e4745883786.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n## System information\r\n\r\n- OS: macOS\r\n- Browser: Chrome\r\n- Version of supabase-js: 1.36.5\r\n- Version of Node.js: 16\r\n",

            "body": "# Bug report\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nUsing a custom JWT was a feature in v1 :\r\n https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/auth-setauth\r\n\r\nPer comment:\r\n https://github.com/supabase/gotrue-js/pull/340#issuecomment-1218065610\r\nwhat we did was establish the custom header and it works for creating the client.\r\n\r\nHowever, it's not working with realtime channels. Upon inspection, the problem is that the internal initialization isn't setting up RealtimeClient's setAuth method:\r\n  https://github.com/supabase/realtime#realtime-rls\r\nwhich in turn causes the web socket to not send the JWT on the messages and heartbeats..\r\n\r\nThe result is that channels fail the RLS.\r\n\r\nA second problem is with setting up a new valid JWT when the previous one expired: there's no way to do it.  Not in the supabase client and much less in the realtime client.\r\n\r\n## To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create a database with a restrictive policy based on a custom JWT\r\n2. Create a JWT with a 1 minute expiration time\r\n3. Create a client using the method explained in \r\n    https://github.com/supabase/gotrue-js/pull/340#issuecomment-1218065610\r\n4.a. Let 2 minutes go by and try to make any call to supabase using supabaseClient.  Access is denied because the JWT has expired.  Try to update the JWT -> there's no way to do it.  Would have to create a new client but that defeats the whole thing.\r\n4.b. Create a channel subscription -> 'fails' by not providing access to rows to which the user has access acording to the policy)\r\n\r\nUpon inspection of the websocket, as it was expected, the messages and heartbeats don't include the custom JWT.. Why whould they? We've only set the header /directly/ and that's it..\r\n\r\n## Workaround\r\n\r\nWhat we've done is changing from protected to public the supabase client's class elements:\r\n   \"headers\" in SupabaseClient\r\n   \"realtime\" in GoTrueClient\r\nand we're calling \r\n  a) supabaseClient.realtime.setAuth(JWT) \r\n  b) supabase.auth.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${JWT}`;\r\nwith the customToken..\r\n\r\nThat keeps everything working..\r\n\r\nTried forking and creating an updateJWT method, but realized we're not very familiar with the modularization philosophy of the project and was most likely being both overkill about it.  Also, were falling short because an alternate method is quite likely required for the initialization, since using the headers option in the createClient doesn't impact the realtime client.\r\n",

To summarize and clarify the issues based on the above, here's what I currently do:\r\n\r\n1. Sign in the user with firebase auth \r\n2. Use an edge fn to verify the user's Firebase token then return a new token signed with the Supabase jwt key\r\n3. Create a client with the following config\r\n```ts\r\nconst db = createClient<Database>(creds.url, creds.key, {\r\n        auth: authOpts,\r\n        global: {\r\n            headers: {\r\n                authorization: `Bearer ${key}`, // my custom token\r\n            },\r\n        },\r\n        realtime: {\r\n            headers: {\r\n                apikey: key, // my custom token returned from my edge fn --docs have it backwards\r\n            },\r\n            params: {\r\n                apikey: creds.key, // the supabase anon key\r\n            },\r\n        },\r\n    })\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis method works up to the point where I need to refresh the user's token, which I want to do whenever their firebase token gets refreshed. I can call my edge fn to verify the new firebase token and generate a new supabase token, but then as @LuisAngelVzz pointed out there isn't a great way to set this new token in the existing client. For now I will use a workaround like was posted above.\r\n\r\nI think there are two things needed to solve these problems:\r\n\r\n1. Provide a method on supabase-js to explicitly handle setting a new custom auth token on an existing client\r\n2. And/or -- provide a `signUpWithCustomToken`/`signInWithCustomToken` option as suggested by @magicseth to create a real gotrue session based on the custom token.\r\n\r\nAre either of these things currently planned to be implemented? If so, when?\r\n\r\nI hope this effectively summarizes the issue. IMO this is likely to be a problem faced by almost everyone attempting to migrate from Firebse so I hope it can get bumped up to a higher priority by the Supabase team.\r\n\r\n",

If expiration is within 10 mins I call `user.getIdTokenResult(true)` to force a refresh and use the resulting token to refresh my custom Supabase token.",

                    "body": "As someone attempting to use a third-party auth, Clerk in this case, here are my thoughts about the direction of implementation for custom tokens. Bear with me here, I'm no master developer, so these are just my thoughts. \r\n\r\nThere seems to be a push to just create a new supabase client for every call and load the token at that time. \r\n\r\nHere are the things that I see that are problematic with this approach:\r\n1. If you have a short-lived token, you have to go fetch or compute the new token for every single call, which can add intense levels of latency to your DB calls. In my case, I have to serve up the token from Clerk, which takes 80-130ms roundtrip, which is now stacked every single time on top of the latency of making the actual db call from supabase.\r\n2. There is also just the straight-up machine overhead of creating new instances of an object over and over again instead of persisting an instantiation of it and just updating the key. De-allocating that memory and re-allocating along with all the other trace logic for every single call is bad practice but not inherently an issue on very small scales. BUT on a large application, this multiplies dramatically. Imagine an application with 5,000 active users and the sheer volume of wasted CPU and memory cycles if you're doing this on the server side. Nightmare. Gives me nightmares equivalent to edge function cold starts on every call. \ud83e\udd2e\r\n3. Connection pooling, I don't know if the supabase-js library supports the automatic pooling of requests. If it does or ever plans to in the future, this implementation would completely eliminate that possibility to pool because you have a total fresh client instantiation for every single call.\r\n\r\nNon-approached based notes of the current state of custom tokens:\r\n1. Unless someone else has found a native route in the current release that doesn't involve significant patching and overrides, Realtime just doesn't seem to function at all with custom tokens once RLS is enabled. I can confirm the docs are indeed backward in terms of where to place your anon and custom token in headers v params. The switch up not by intention/design but in functionality/existing codebase it just does not work if you place the keys in the order defined in the docs. It will fail to open the websocket period. However, even when you reverse the tokens and are able to now retrieve data via realtime, once you enable RLS, it is full stop, even with a fully permissive RLS policy. No updates are shipped to custom token subscribers. Maybe I'm missing something here, but I've been round and round with no luck. @evelant have you had any luck with realtime once RLS is enabled? I suspect that realtime is refusing to acknowledge the aud and role from the custom token claims and thus isn't treating the realtime client as an authenticated user. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\r\n\r\nDesign Opinion on Ideal solution:\r\nAs some others have pointed out, it seems to be the ideal outcome here is really to sidestep this process by allowing login to supabase with the custom token. So effectively leveraging supabase auth but exclusively for database access purposes when using a third party auth or custom token. Once logged in you could utilize the existing token infrastructure that supabase uses directly instead of getting a new token from your auth provider every single call or upon expiration and handling all that logic yourself. In the case of a third-party auth provider, the one drawback here is obviously that supabase would not know when the user is logged out of their auth provider, but I suppose if that is important somehow to prevent the user from continuing to be able to pull data, you could implement a heartbeat edge function that checks with the auth provider to see if their session is expired?\r\n\r\nThat's just my 2 cents on that. I apologize in advance if that's a dumb idea, I'm not super well versed in the security considerations of JWT authentication.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, because I am planning for a production app, I am not comfortable applying the very innovative hacks that others have put together here form @Mukhammadali  and @evelant . So I am now left with a choice of losing my chosen Auth implementation, losing supabase, or coming up with some hyper custom implementation using a self-designed middleware. \r\n\r\nAny thoughts @w3b6x9 @kangmingtay @silentworks ?\r\n",

Instead the problem is that realtime postgres change listeners are authenticated as `anon`, despite me setting the headers as suggested.\r\n\r\nRequests from postgres-js work fine with the token, they get the proper `authenticated` role and `sub`. Realtime however does not appear to use the custom token and treats the connection as `anon` so it probably fails most RLS rules preventing anonymous access.\r\n\r\n\r\n@w3b6x9 having realtime work with a custom token is a requirement for us to switch from firebase to supabase. We can't migrate our auth yet so we have to continue using firebase auth which means we need to have custom tokens working or we can't migrate to Supabase.

It's `{\"exp\": 1983812996, \"iss\": \"supabase-demo\", \"role\": \"anon\"}` instead of the actual custom token I'm sending from the client.\r\n\r\nI also see this in the docker logs for the local realtime container when I try to start a subscription without giving `anon` privilege \r\n\r\n```\r\nSubscribing to PostgreSQL failed: {:error, \"Subscription insert failed with error: ERROR P0001 (raise_exception) invalid column for filter docId.

You can scroll to the bottom for database setup if you would like to reproduce it.\r\n\r\nHere's how the Supabase provided `anon` token and your custom token are being used once passed in to `supabase-js` client.\r\n\r\nProviding this here for convenient reference:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst supabase = createClient(process.env.SUPABASE_URL, process.env.SUPABASE_KEY, {\r\n  realtime: {\r\n    headers: {\r\n      apikey: 'supabase-provided-anon-token',\r\n    },\r\n    params: {\r\n      apikey: 'your-custom-token',\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe Supabase `anon` token that is provided to your Supabase project is checked in our Cloudflare API gateway to make sure that the project is valid and active. Then the gateway forwards the request, along with your custom token found under `realtime.params.apikey` in the options object, to our Realtime servers. \r\n\r\nRealtime servers will check your custom token and make sure it's signed by your project's JWT secret. If you're listening to Postgres changes it will then insert this custom token's claims into your project database's `realtime.subscription` table.\r\n\r\nIf you decide to reproduce my Replit example, you'll see in the `realtime.subscription` table that the claims is that of the custom signed token.\r\n\r\nLike @evelant mentioned earlier (https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js/issues/553#issuecomment-1492242754) I have removed the `protected` flag so you can call `supabaseClient.realtime.setAuth(token)` when you want to pass Realtime a refreshed token without `ts` complaining.\r\n\r\n> Note that the description of the Supabase anon key in the docs is also confusing:\r\n> \r\n> \"The apikey in headers must be either the anon or service_role token that Supabase signed\"\r\n> \r\n> Other than this needing to be the apikey in params not headers, it should probably also say \"that Supabase provides\" rather than \"that Supabase signed\".\r\n\r\n@yamen thanks, this is good feedback! will go and update the docs so it's more obvious.",

                    "body": "Hi @rdylina, just wanted to chime in on the feedback around the following:\r\n\r\n> If you have a short-lived token, you have to go fetch or compute the new token for every single call, which can add intense levels of latency to your DB calls. In my case, I have to serve up the token from Clerk, which takes 80-130ms roundtrip, which is now stacked every single time on top of the latency of making the actual db call from supabase.\r\n\r\nI feel like this is the tradeoff for using another auth provider here. But then again, i would like to hear how we can improve this from you. We could think about adding a method to sign in with a custom token, but then verifying that the custom token is legit and dealing with the logout issue you mentioned don't seem trivial.  \r\n\r\n\r\n> There is also just the straight-up machine overhead of creating new instances of an object over and over again instead of persisting an instantiation of it and just updating the key. De-allocating that memory and re-allocating along with all the other trace logic for every single call is bad practice but not inherently an issue on very small scales. BUT on a large application, this multiplies dramatically. Imagine an application with 5,000 active users and the sheer volume of wasted CPU and memory cycles if you're doing this on the server side. Nightmare. Gives me nightmares equivalent to edge function cold starts on every call. \ud83e\udd2e\r\n\r\nJust to provide some context, we used to have a method called `setAuth()` which allowed one to reuse a single server-side supabase client across multiple requests (each new request would call `setAuth()` to set the custom token in the authorization header) which is not secure. Depending on the client use, it could lead to one user sending requests as another user. So even if we added it back, we\u2019d still be advising that users create a new client per request.\r\n\r\nIn terms of memory usage, we are using this pattern of creating new instances of an object each time a request is made for the Supabase platform. We use our own auth and client libs and we aren't running into any of these performance issues mentioned. I've also done some napkin math for the memory consumed:\r\n\r\nThe `createClient()` call allocates ~250kb each time it's called. Assuming there are 10,000 calls / second to `createClient()` , it will only take up 0.0025gb in memory. Assuming you're using the smallest AWS instance type available (t4g.nano - 0.5gb memory) and that the node's GC runs at a frequency that's less than a sec (which is very lazy - node's GC tends to be on the more aggressive side), you would still have alot of unused memory left.   \r\n\r\n> Connection pooling, I don't know if the supabase-js library supports the automatic pooling of requests. If it does or ever plans to in the future, this implementation would completely eliminate that possibility to pool because you have a total fresh client instantiation for every single call.\r\n\r\nAre you referring to the database connection pooling here? We don't create a new connection to the database on every call. Each service has it's own fixed connection pool size and they use their own poolers. The client library just serves as a JS interface to interact with the RESTful APIs. \r\n\r\nHope that clarifies things and really appreciate the time and effort to provide such detailed feedback as well!",

My thoughts are below.\r\n\r\n> Hi @rdylina, just wanted to chime in on the feedback around the following:\r\n> \r\n> > If you have a short-lived token, you have to go fetch or compute the new token for every single call, which can add intense levels of latency to your DB calls. In my case, I have to serve up the token from Clerk, which takes 80-130ms roundtrip, which is now stacked every single time on top of the latency of making the actual db call from supabase.\r\n> \r\n> I feel like this is the tradeoff for using another auth provider here. But then again, i would like to hear how we can improve this from you. We could think about adding a method to sign in with a custom token, but then verifying that the custom token is legit and dealing with the logout issue you mentioned don't seem trivial.\r\n> \r\n\r\nCurrently, I am solving for this by making my token longer lived (120 seconds) and then caching it and only requesting updated tokens based on the current token's expiration minus 5 seconds. Not the most elegant of solutions but it beats polling for every request.\r\n\r\n> > There is also just the straight-up machine overhead of creating new instances of an object over and over again instead of persisting an instantiation of it and just updating the key. De-allocating that memory and re-allocating along with all the other trace logic for every single call is bad practice but not inherently an issue on very small scales. BUT on a large application, this multiplies dramatically. Imagine an application with 5,000 active users and the sheer volume of wasted CPU and memory cycles if you're doing this on the server side. Nightmare. Gives me nightmares equivalent to edge function cold starts on every call. \ud83e\udd2e\r\n> \r\n> Just to provide some context, we used to have a method called `setAuth()` which allowed one to reuse a single server-side supabase client across multiple requests (each new request would call `setAuth()` to set the custom token in the authorization header) which is not secure. Depending on the client use, it could lead to one user sending requests as another user. So even if we added it back, we\u2019d still be advising that users create a new client per request.\r\n> \r\n> In terms of memory usage, we are using this pattern of creating new instances of an object each time a request is made for the Supabase platform. We use our own auth and client libs and we aren't running into any of these performance issues mentioned. I've also done some napkin math for the memory consumed:\r\n> \r\n> The `createClient()` call allocates ~250kb each time it's called. Assuming there are 10,000 calls / second to `createClient()` , it will only take up 0.0025gb in memory. Assuming you're using the smallest AWS instance type available (t4g.nano - 0.5gb memory) and that the node's GC runs at a frequency that's less than a sec (which is very lazy - node's GC tends to be on the more aggressive side), you would still have alot of unused memory left.\r\n> \r\n\r\nMy concern regarding memory wasn't really the maximum point in time utilization but the pure machine overhead of allocating the memory and then deallocating and/or garbage collecting. I come from a background in lower-level machine languages, and, for better or worse, it makes me cringe how flippant we as a group are with higher-level languages in the way we treat compute overhead. It's just my natural instinct to minimize overhead and maximize performant design patterns. \ud83d\ude48 Maybe I'm over the top on this topic.\r\n\r\n> > Connection pooling, I don't know if the supabase-js library supports the automatic pooling of requests. If it does or ever plans to in the future, this implementation would completely eliminate that possibility to pool because you have a total fresh client instantiation for every single call.\r\n> \r\n> Are you referring to the database connection pooling here? We don't create a new connection to the database on every call. Each service has it's own fixed connection pool size and they use their own poolers. The client library just serves as a JS interface to interact with the RESTful APIs.\r\n> \r\n> Hope that clarifies things and really appreciate the time and effort to provide such detailed feedback as well!\r\n\r\nThank you for the clarification. I wasn't sure if any of the REST apis support batched queries or if that was a thing that was ever on the roadmap.\r\n\r\nI super appreciate you taking the time to write out such a detailed response.\r\n\r\n",

                    "body": "@w3b6x9  Let me clarify exactly what I'm doing and exactly the behavior I'm seeing so hopefully there isn't any confusion.\r\n\r\nAt a high level, my app does this:\r\n1. On app start, check for a firebase auth token\r\n2. If no firebase auth exists create an anonymous user\r\n3. Send the firebase auth token to my edge function `generateToken` which verifies the firebase token then signs a new token with the supabase JWT_KEY and the role `authenticated`\r\n4. The app takes the newly minted token and creates a client like so\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport const setupDbConnection = async (\r\n    localStorageInstance: { getItem: any; setItem: any; removeItem: any },\r\n    firebaseToken: string\r\n) => {\r\n    const key = await getTokenFromFirebaseToken(firebaseToken)\r\n\r\n    const authOpts = {\r\n        storage: localStorageInstance,\r\n        autoRefreshToken: false,\r\n        persistSession: false,\r\n        detectSessionInUrl: false,\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    const db = createClient<Database>(creds.url, creds.key, {\r\n        auth: authOpts,\r\n        global: {\r\n            headers: {\r\n                Authorization: `Bearer ${key}`,  // custom token with 'authenticated' role signed with jwt secret\r\n            },\r\n        },\r\n        realtime: {\r\n            headers: {\r\n                apikey: `Bearer ${key}`, // custom token with 'authenticated' role signed with jwt secret\r\n            },\r\n            params: {\r\n                apikey: creds.key, // supabase anon key\r\n            },\r\n        },\r\n    })\r\n\r\n    db.realtime.setAuth(key)\r\n    return db\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n5. Now everything works in local dev, including realtime which has the proper 'autheticated' claim entry in `realtime.subscription`\r\n6. Periodically (every minute) and upon app returning from the background (it's a react-native app) check for firebase token expiry. If firebase token is expired or refreshed then refresh the custom token by calling `generateToken` edge fn again\r\n7. Update the existing supabase client instance with the newly minted token with this code\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport const refreshSupabaseTokenFromFirebaseToken = async (\r\n    db: TaskHeroSupabaseClient | null,\r\n    firebaseToken: string\r\n) => {\r\n  if (!db) {\r\n        throw `db not initialized yet`\r\n    }\r\n    const key = await getTokenFromFirebaseToken(firebaseToken)\r\n  \r\n    //@ts-ignore protected field\r\n    db.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${key}`\r\n    //@ts-ignore\r\n    db.auth.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${key}`\r\n    //@ts-ignore\r\n    db.rest.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${key}`\r\n    db.realtime.setAuth(key)\r\n\r\n    if (db.realtime.params) {\r\n        db.realtime.params.apikey = `Bearer ${key}`\r\n    }\r\n    db.functions.setAuth(key)\r\n   \r\n    return key\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter doing this everything still works in local development. In production deployment everything works _except realtime_ which no longer receives updates. To summarize the problems:\r\n\r\n1. Docs are backwards, at least for local dev, realtime headers must be custom token and params must be supabase anon key. This setup works 100% correctly for realtime in dev.\r\n2. In production realtime works with the same configuration as in dev _until_ calling `setAuth` with a refreshed token.\r\n\r\nI hope that clarifies exactly what's happening for me and helps track down the problem. Please ask any questions if you need clarification.",

It sounds like you need some headers for other services but for Realtime you don't. \r\n\r\nCouple updates:\r\n - Realtime Docs are updated: https://github.com/supabase/supabase/pull/15388\r\n - You can use the Inspector on realtime.supabase.com with a custom JWT: https://github.com/supabase/realtime/pull/592\r\n \r\nI'm also trying to get something official up in our docs wrt using your own JWTs across the whole platform.

This is not a web server that uses the private token in admin mode, nor does it \"impersonate\" a client using setAuthheader. It's a standalone desktop application that uses auth.signInWithPassword();\r\n\r\nThe sign in attempt is succesfull, but none of the db related methods seem to utilize the session. Only the realtime module \"sees\" the session.\r\n\r\n## To Reproduce\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior, please provide code snippets or a repository:\r\n\r\n1. Create a completely empty node js app\r\n2. Install Supabase JS V2 (RC10 at the time of writing)\r\n3. create an index.js file and inside do:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst { createClient } = require(\"@supabase/supabase-js\");\r\n\r\nconst client = createClient(\"INSERT_HOST_HERE\", \"INSERT_PUBLIC_ANON_KEY_HERE\");\r\n\r\nclient.auth.onAuthStateChange((event, session) => {\r\n  if (event === \"SIGNED_IN\") {\r\n    client\r\n      .from(\"table\")\r\n      .select(\"*\")\r\n      .then(({ data, error }) => {\r\n        //if RLS is checking email or uid in the policy, this will not get the rows that match\r\n      });\r\n    client\r\n      .channel(\"*\")\r\n      .on(\"postgres_changes\", { event: \"*\", schema: \"*\" }, (payload) => {\r\n        //this will work just fine, it passes the session to the api and gets notifications according to RLS\r\n      })\r\n      .subscribe();\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n\r\nclient.auth.signInWithPassword({email: 'insert valid email here', password: 'insert valid password here'});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe db api call should use the session that was just established\r\n\r\n## System information\r\n\r\n- OS: macOS\r\n- Version of supabase-js: V2 RC 10\r\n- Version of Node.js: v18.9.0\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\nSince the exact same code works just fine in the browser, wIthout going deep into the sdk code, this looks like an issue with localStoarge not being available in node?\r\nHowever, I patched in localStorage and it still could not get the established session. No difference at all.\r\n\r\n\r\nI know this usecase isn't very common, but it works awesomely for us on V1.x and I'm worried we will get stuck on it forever.\r\nIf you have any pointers, I could take a stab at a fix.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks so much for such an awesome open source project! \u2764\ufe0f ",

            "body": "# Bug report\r\n\r\n## Describe the bug\r\n\r\nWhen setting `auth.persistSession` for a client, you have to wrap the object in an `options` object. When setting `global.headers`, you don't. Unless I'm misunderstanding and jacking something up.\r\n\r\nWhen I set `persistSession: false`, I'm expecting the localStorage info to be deleted on logout. This only happens if I do the above. Likewise, the client won't properly set the global headers, and retrieve data behind RLS, unless I exclude the `options` wrapper.\r\n\r\n## To Reproduce\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/j4w8n/sveltekit-supabase-oauth\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'\r\nimport { PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL } from '$env/static/public'\r\n\r\nexport const supabaseClient = createClient(PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, {\r\n  options: {\r\n    auth: {\r\n      persistSession: false\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n\r\nexport let supabaseServerClient\r\nexport const createSupabaseServerClient = (access_token) => {\r\n  supabaseServerClient = createClient(PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, {\r\n    global: {\r\n      headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${access_token}` }\r\n    }\r\n  })\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nPer the [docs](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/next/initializing#with-additional-parameters), you shouldn't have to use an `options` wrapper.\r\n\r\n## System information\r\n\r\n- OS: macOS\r\n- Browser (if applies): Firefox\r\n- Version of supabase-js: 2.0.0-rc.10\r\n- Version of Node.js: 16.15.0\r\n\r\n## Additional Context\r\n\r\nI'm creating two clients. One for use on the client-side and one for use on the server-side. I'm defining the server-side client inside of a function; which gets called in `hooks.server.js` for every request the server receives.\r\n",

For that you need to use one of the auth-helpers for your platform (Next, Svelte, Remix, etc). The auth-helpers include wrappers around the supabase client for both the browser and server envs. The wrappers handle the cookies. Unfortunately the wrappers do not include a version for the Vercel serverless platform (only for Next, which is slightly different). So I had to build my own wrappers using the Next wrappers as inspiration.",

            "body": "# Bug report\r\n\r\n## Describe the bug\r\n\r\nExecuting basic Supabase client queries in a NextJS app doesn't seem to return any rows unless RLS (\"row-level security\") is disabled in the dashboard. Although writes should be protected, it should nevertheless still be possible to _read_ data with RLS enabled.\r\n\r\n## To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create a new Supabase project.\r\n2. Define a basic schema and add (at least) one row. **Ensure that RLS is enabled** (it should be enabled by default).\r\n3. Locally, create a new NextJS project with `npx create-next-app@latest --use-npm test-project`.\r\n4. `npm install @supabase/supabase-js`.\r\n5. Create an `.env.local` file and add two variables to it: (i) `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - the Supabase URL found on your project home page; (ii) `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - the Supabase anon key, also found on your project home page.\r\n6. In your NextJS app, edit `pages/index.js` to instantiate the Supabase client with `const supabase = createClient(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY)`.\r\n7. Call the client to pull data from the DB, e.g. -\r\n\r\n```\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    getEntries()\r\n  }, [])\r\n\r\n  async function getEntries() {\r\n    const { data, error } = await supabase.from('entries').select()\r\n\r\n    if (error) {\r\n      console.log(error.message)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    if (data) {\r\n      console.log(data)\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n8. Start the dev server with `npm run dev`.\r\n9. Browse to the URL (usually `localhost:3000`) and refresh the page.\r\n\r\nYou should be able to see that the console logs out an empty array i.e. is unable to fetch data.\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nA array of objects containing DB data should be logged to the console.\r\n\r\n## System information\r\n\r\n- OS: macOS Monterey 12.2.1\r\n- Browser: Firefox\r\n- Version of supabase-js: `2.0.4`\r\n- Version of Node.js: `14.8.12`\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\nOne solution to this is to **disble RLS**, although in the ideal case it would be possible to keep RLS and just allow reads by NextJS clients.\r\n\r\nAlso, it appears that this problem has been experienced by other users, e.g. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71294440/supabase-in-next-js-returning-an-empty-array-when-data-is-in-relevant-tables.\r\n",

The correct way to do this would be to not have any space between the values you're trying to filter on.\r\n\r\nTry this, it should work - `supabase.from('people').not('owner', 'in', '(Owner_1,Owner_2)'` (notice the lack of space between 'Owner_1' and 'Owner_2').\r\n\r\nAlso a side note, keep in mind to sanitize your values, in case you plan to use dynamic values to filter upon. Note from documentation.\r\n```\r\nMatch only rows which doesn't satisfy the filter.\r\nUnlike most filters, opearator and value are used as-is and need to follow [PostgREST syntax](https://postgrest.org/en/stable/api.html#operators). \r\nYou also need to make sure they are properly sanitized.\r\n```",

Can't I just use the user returned?\r\n\r\nIn this app I am not exposing the supabase-client at all in the browser. All the code is run server-side. I am creating a secure cookie that contains the access and refresh tokens (encrypted). So, every request from the client to the server will pass that cookie and I will then be able to authenticate the user (via `setSession`).\r\n\r\nShould I then update the refresh-token in my cookie after the call, if it has changed?

I was getting `util.inherits is not a function`, because I was trying to use one client for both express and react app (it is a monorepo, why duplicate configs). Anyway, [one guy](https://www.thecodingcouple.com/uncaught-typeerror-util-inherits-is-not-a-function/\r\n) was having an issue with the `util.inherits` and the underlaying problem was that he was using `jsonwebtoken` that doesn't want to work with Vite because some nodejs APIs are not polyfilled. I split my code into two separate clients, which solved the `util.inherits is not a function` bug, but it gave me the `invalid claim: missing sub claim` one.\r\n\r\nCould it be that the underlying issue is in Supabasejs not communicating properly with server-based build frameworks? This library is using `jsonwebtoken`. The \"bug progression\" on my end could indicate that `jsonwebtoken` is missing context, since it is not polyfilled anywhere. This problem also exists for browser's storage APIs and I bet `jsonwebtoken` is used here to en/decode data.\r\n\r\nSince Supabasejs is isomorphic the solution could be in polyfilling `jsonwebtoken`'s missing node APIs or replacing `jwt` with eg. [jose](https://github.com/panva/jose) that seems to be supported across environemnts.\r\n\r\nI have no idea if any of this applies to `invalid claim: missing sub claim`, but I am going to debug it some more to narrow down the problem.",

Create an \ud83d\udc49 `index.html` file\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script type=\"importmap\">\r\n  {\r\n    \"imports\": {\r\n      \"@supabase/functions-js\": \"./node_modules/@supabase/functions-js/dist/module/index.js\",\r\n      \"@supabase/gotrue-js\": \"./node_modules/@supabase/gotrue-js/dist/module/index.js\",\r\n      \"@supabase/postgres-js\": \"./node_modules/@supabase/postgres-js/dist/module/index.js\",\r\n      \"@supabase/realtime-js\": \"./node_modules/@supabase/realtime-js/dist/module/index.js\",\r\n      \"@supabase/storage-js\": \"./node_modules/@supabase/storage-js/dist/module/index.js\",\r\n      \"@supabase/supabase-js\": \"./node_modules/@supabase/supabase-js/dist/module/index.js\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<script type=\"module\">\r\n  import { createClient } from \"@supabase/supabase-js\";\r\n  console.log(createClient);\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. server it with any webserver (npx http-server, apache, nginx...)\r\n3. open it in the browser (chrome - for import maps support)\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nLogs createClient implementation\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```\r\nGET http://127.0.0.1:8080/node_modules/@supabase/realtime-js/dist/module/RealtimeClient net::ERR_ABORTED 404 (Not Found)       index.js:1\r\nGET http://127.0.0.1:8080/node_modules/@supabase/realtime-js/dist/module/RealtimeChannel net::ERR_ABORTED 404 (Not Found)      index.js:2             \r\nGET http://127.0.0.1:8080/node_modules/@supabase/realtime-js/dist/module/RealtimePresence net::ERR_ABORTED 404 (Not Found)     index.js:3             \r\nGET http://127.0.0.1:8080/node_modules/@supabase/gotrue-js/dist/module/lib/helpers net::ERR_ABORTED 404 (Not Found)            GoTrueAdminApi.js:22   \r\nGET http://127.0.0.1:8080/node_modules/@supabase/gotrue-js/dist/module/lib/fetch net::ERR_ABORTED 404 (Not Found)              GoTrueAdminApi.js:21   \r\nGET http://127.0.0.1:8080/node_modules/@supabase/gotrue-js/dist/module/lib/errors net::ERR_ABORTED 404 (Not Found)             GoTrueAdminApi.js:23   \r\nGET http://127.0.0.1:8080/node_modules/@supabase/gotrue-js/dist/module/lib/constants net::ERR_ABORTED 404 (Not Found)          GoTrueClient.js:11     \r\nGET http://127.0.0.1:8080/node_modules/@supabase/gotrue-js/dist/module/GoTrueAdminApi net::ERR_ABORTED 404 (Not Found)         GoTrueClient.js:10     \r\n```\r\n\r\n## Ideas\r\n\r\nthe above suggests that in the source code there are imports like\r\n```js\r\nimport RealtimeChannel from './RealtimeChannel';\r\n```\r\nwhich is impossible to know for the browser what to load... `.js`?, `.mjs`? ... \r\nalso a browser cannot do da http request for each possibility to check what is available...\r\n\r\ne.g. we need to be more explicit... e.g. it should be\r\n```js\r\nimport RealtimeChannel from './RealtimeChannel.js';\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Follup up Issues\r\n\r\nif the local import paths are solved a separate issue pops up\r\n\r\n```\r\nUncaught SyntaxError: The requested module './node_modules/cross-fetch/dist/browser-ponyfill.js' does not provide an export named 'fetch' (at index.html:2:12)\r\n```\r\n\r\n`cross-fetch` sadly does offer an es module version... I opened an issue\r\n\r\nadditionally also `websocket` seems to not offer an es module version... \r\n\r\nso 2 dependencies we will need to \"fix\"\r\n\r\n## What do you think?\r\n\r\nI would really like to use supabase directly in the browser without any tools or build steps \ud83e\udd17\r\nAlso, I think with a few small changes and some updates/or different dependencies it should be possible to get this \ud83d\ude4f\r\n\r\nIf that is something you would like to support then I could certainly help make it happen \ud83e\udd17\r\n\r\n## System information\r\n\r\n- OS: macOS [e.g. macOS, Windows]\r\n- Browser: chrome (if applies) [e.g. chrome, safari]\r\n- Version of supabase-js: 2.2.1\r\n- Version of Node.js: 18\r\n\r\n",

Clone this repo https://github.com/skulltech/sample-realtime-app\r\n2. Run `yarn install` and `supabase start`, and then `yarn dev` to start the server.\r\n4. Go to `http://localhost:3000` and check the console to see the above mentioned error.\r\n6. The webapp has some basic functionality for writing and reading to database to make sure that the other Supabase functionalities are working as expected. \r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nNo errors while subscribing to the realtime channel.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-01-08 at 1 13 15 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16862545/211167834-86794b4e-3525-4e72-a850-d086a52d607f.png\">\r\n\r\n## System information\r\n\r\n- OS: macOS\r\n- Browser: Chrome\r\n- Version of supabase-js: 2.2.3\r\n- Version of Node.js: v19.4.0\r\n- Version of Supabase CLI: 1.29.2\r\n- Version of Docker desktop for Mac: 4.15.0\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\nThe same code seems to be working on production Supabase at app.supabase.com.\r\n\r\nThe same code was working before I updated my whole stack, i.e. updated Supabase CLI as well as @supabase/supabase-js, moved to Postgres v15 locally (i.e. in config.toml), from v14 previously, and ran brew upgrade which included updating docker desktop.\r\n",

            "body": "# Bug report\r\n\r\nThis weekend I moved from v1.35.6 to 2.2.3. I noticed that all of my non-auth api calls were returning empty lists, and attempts at creating new records gave me a row level security error.\r\n\r\nI intercepted my traffic and noticed that the `apiKey` and `authorization` headers were both using my api key, so I dug into the code. I couldn't easily figure out if this was a bug or not, but I noticed that I could set a custom global `authorization` header. I tried that with my user access token, setting the `authorization` header to \"bearer xxxxx\" and my requests all worked.\r\n\r\nIs this the intended way of making authorized network requests in SSR? Should `setSession` work? Is there another solution?\r\n\r\n## To Reproduce\r\n\r\nCreate your client with the following code in a SSR typescript environment\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst client = createClient<Database>(url, apiKey);\r\n\r\nawait client.auth.setSession({\r\n    access_token: token,\r\n    refresh_token: refreshToken\r\n});\r\n\r\n```\r\nThen enable your traffic logging, be it wireshark or a passing a custom fetch function to `createClient`, or using other node debugging tools, and make the following request.\r\n\r\n```\r\nconsole.log(await supabase.from(table).select(query)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe data you see should reflect a logged out state, and your logs should show the `apiKey` header and `authorization` headers are using the same tokens.\r\n\r\nWhen I switch my `createClient` code to the following, everything works as expected. Notice I stopped using setSession entirely and provide my own manual global authorization header.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\tconst client = createClient<Database>(url, apiKey,\r\n\t\ttoken\r\n\t\t\t? {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tglobal: {\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\theaders: {\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAuthorization: `Bearer ${token}`\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t  }\r\n\t\t\t: undefined\r\n\t);\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nFrom reading the docs I expected `setSession` to \"log in\" my client, configuring it to properly send the authorization header along with all subsequent requests, as detailed in https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/server-side-rendering#bringing-it-together. \r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\nI have none at the moment, let me know if you would like me to provide more.\r\n\r\n## System information\r\n\r\n- OS: Ubuntu 22.04\r\n- Browser: N/A\r\n- Version of supabase-js: 2.2.3\r\n- Version of Node.js: 19.3.0 and 16.13.1 both saw this error\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\nI think that's it. Let me know if you need any more information!",

For example, for `PostgrestResponseSuccess<A | B>`, `data` is of type `(A | B)[]`, when it should be of type `A[] | B[]`.\r\n\r\nThis is problematic because `(A | B)[]`, an array that contains both type `A` and `B` entries, isn't a valid return type for a database `SELECT` query, while the correct type, `A[] | B[]`, generates a type error.\r\n\r\n## To Reproduce\r\n\r\nTo illustrate, consider a generic `useTable` hook which takes in `tableName` and returns a Tanstack Query `useQuery` hook that loads a table from Supabase.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport { useQuery } from \"@tanstack/react-query\";\r\nimport { useSupabaseClient } from \"@supabase/auth-helpers-react\";\r\nimport { PostgrestError } from \"@supabase/supabase-js\";\r\n\r\n// Database types\r\ninterface Research {\r\n    id: string;\r\n    research: string;\r\n}\r\n\r\ninterface Link {\r\n    id: string;\r\n    link: string;\r\n}\r\n\r\ninterface Result {\r\n    id: string;\r\n    result: string;\r\n}\r\n\r\ntype TableName = \"researches\" | \"links\" | \"results\";\r\n\r\ntype Response<TableName> = {\r\n    data:\r\n        | (TableName extends \"researches\"\r\n              ? Research[]\r\n              : TableName extends \"links\"\r\n              ? Link[]\r\n              : TableName extends \"results\"\r\n              ? Result[]\r\n              : any[])\r\n        | null;\r\n    error: PostgrestError | null;\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default function useTable(tableName: TableName) {\r\n    const supabase = useSupabaseClient();\r\n\r\n    const { isLoading, data } = useQuery({\r\n        queryKey: [tableName],\r\n        queryFn: async () => {\r\n            /*    Type error here!\r\n                  vvvvvvvvvvvvvvv  */\r\n            const { data, error }: Response<TableName> = await supabase\r\n                .from(tableName)\r\n                .select(\"*\");\r\n            if (error) throw error;\r\n            return data;\r\n        },\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    return { isLoading, data };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe full type error generated is as follows:\r\n```\r\nType 'PostgrestResponse<Research | Link | Result>' is not assignable to type 'Response<TableName>'.\r\n  Type 'PostgrestResponseSuccess<Research | Link | Result>' is not assignable to type 'Response<TableName>'.\r\n    Types of property 'data' are incompatible.\r\n      Type '(Research | Link | Result)[]' is not assignable to type 'Research[] | Link[] | Result[] | null'.\r\n        Type '(Research | Link | Result)[]' is not assignable to type 'Research[]'.\r\n          Type 'Research | Link | Result' is not assignable to type 'Research'.\r\n            Property 'research' is missing in type 'Link' but required in type 'Research'.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, our supplied `Response<TableName>` generates the correct type, `Research[] | Link[] | Result[] | null`, which is what we expect returned from the database.\r\n\r\nHowever, Typescript tries to assign it to `(Research | Link | Result)[]`, an array that mixes `Research`, `Link`, and `Result` entries. This should, in no circumstance, be returned from the database. Hence, the type handling here is incorrect.\r\n\r\n## The fix\r\n\r\nThe fix is to allow the generic type `T` of `PostgrestResponseSuccess<T>` to be transformed into a distributive type if `T` is a union type. This can be implemented by adding a type `ToArray<T>`, as follows:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ntype ToArray<T> = T extends any ? T[] : never;\r\n\r\ninterface PostgrestResponseSuccess<T> extends PostgrestResponseBase {\r\n    error: null;\r\n    data: ToArray<T>;\r\n    count: number | null;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the fix in place, `PostgrestResponseSuccess<Research | Link | Result>` can be assigned correctly to `Response<TableName>`.\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\nDistributive Conditional Types: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/conditional-types.html#distributive-conditional-types\r\n\r\n",

However, I checked the localstorage value for both cases and found no discernible difference. My API Edge Network logs look fine too, and show Supabase returning a 200 on the request to /profiles no matter the version used.\r\n\r\n## To Reproduce\r\nI call the following code to log in:\r\n`async function signInWithGoogle() {\r\n  const { data, error } = await supabaseApp.auth.signInWithOAuth({\r\n    provider: 'google',\r\n    options: {\r\n      redirectTo: window.location.origin + '/sign-in-redirect'\r\n    }\r\n  })\r\n  return !!error\r\n}`\r\n\r\nand then from the page they're redirected to:\r\n`async function getCurrUserProfile() {\r\n  const { data, error } = await supabaseApp\r\n    .from('profiles')\r\n    .select();\r\n  if (data && data.length > 0) { return data[0] };\r\n  return error;\r\n}` (Here I rely on an RLS policy where users only see their own profile)\r\n\r\nThe code never moves past awaiting the db call. When called in 2.4.0 though, or after logging in on 2.4.0, everything works fine.\r\n\r\n## System information\r\n- OS: Linux (Debian 11)\r\n- Browser: Firefox\r\n",

For this application, I installed ```@supabase/supabase-js``` with version 2.7.0. \r\n\r\nAfter setting up the Vue app and implementing the supabase_url and supabase_anon_key in an init file in the project, I added ```const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();``` inside a vue-router route guard in order to retrieve the user then add the user to a conditional that prevents accessing the app before logging in. The inclusion of ```supabase.auth.getUser();``` prompts a 401 error in the console that says: \"**invalid claim: missing sub claim**\". This message appears when logged out of the app. After logging into the app, the error message goes away. \r\n\r\n## To Reproduce\r\n\r\nTo get the error, I added \"supabase.auth.getUser();\" to the following route guard.\r\n\r\n```\r\nrouter.beforeEach(async (to, from, next) => {\r\n  const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();\r\n\r\n  if (to.matched.some((res) => res.meta.auth)) {\r\n    if (user) {\r\n      next();\r\n      return;\r\n    }\r\n    next({ name: \"Login\" });\r\n    return;\r\n  }\r\n  next();\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nWhen I am logged out, I expect no errors to appear.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2023-02-03 at 9 52 00 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49799116/216694617-f0cdbd87-537f-42b7-a031-78381aa34323.png)\r\n![Screen Shot 2023-02-03 at 9 51 40 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49799116/216694619-dd72e0e1-f5cf-40a2-ad7d-8909415ab523.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## System information\r\n\r\n- OS: [e.g. macOS, Windows] - MacOS\r\n- Browser (if applies) [e.g. chrome, safari] - Chrome\r\n- Version of supabase-js: [e.g. 6.0.2] - 2.7.0\r\n- Version of Node.js: [e.g. 10.10.0] - 16.13.2\r\n",

            "body": "# Bug report\r\n\r\n## Describe the bug\r\n\r\nWhen a signed in user (with password) wants to connect to a Google calendar they are able to view the calendar for one hour until the session expires. At this time, the app refreshes the session. The refresh seems successful except that the refresh only refreshes the session with GoTrue but does not refresh the provider token.\r\n\r\nI might be approaching OAuth API connections in a not-the-supabase-way. Please let me know if this is the case.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n## To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Sign in a user with a password (standard Supabase stuff here)\r\n2. Sign in again with OAuth and scopes for connecting a Google calendar\r\n3. Upon receiving the user back after the OAuth redirect, listen for auth state changes and save the provider token to continue using the Google Calendar API\r\n4. Returns later on when the access token has expired. The access token/refresh token are refreshed but the provider token remains expired and can no longer retrieve data from the Google API.\r\n\r\nStep 2:\r\n```typescript\r\ngetSupabase().auth.signInWithOAuth({\r\n    provider: \"google\",\r\n    options: {\r\n      scopes:\r\n        \"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events\",\r\n      redirectTo: url(\"/oauth/calendar/callback\"),\r\n    },\r\n  });\r\n```\r\n\r\nSTEP 3:\r\n```typescript\r\n    getSupabase().auth.onAuthStateChange((event, session) => {\r\n      if (event === \"SIGNED_IN\") {\r\n        // I can look at the session details here and confirm that they are not stored in the database\r\n        console.log({ anAuthStateChange: session });\r\n        const formData = new FormData();\r\n        formData.append(\"session\", JSON.stringify(session));\r\n\r\n        // We're using the database to store the provider token and refresh token (security concerns, possibly)\r\n        submit(formData, { method: \"post\" });\r\n      }\r\n    });\r\n```\r\n\r\nSTEP 4:\r\n```typescript\r\n  if (isExpiringSoon(session.expires_at)) {\r\n    const newSession = await getSupabase(session.access_token).auth.refreshSession(session);\r\n    // We expect to get back a refreshed provider token here but do not so the next line is only partially successful\r\n    saveRefreshedCalendarSession(newSession);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n`getSupabase` function uses the `createClient` function under the hood with these settings (inspired by [supa-fly-stack](https://github.com/rphlmr/supa-fly-stack)). Using `persistSession` `true` or `false` doesn't seem to make a difference for this issue.\r\n```typescript\r\n  const global = accessToken\r\n    ? {\r\n        global: {\r\n          headers: {\r\n            Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`,\r\n          },\r\n        },\r\n      }\r\n    : {};\r\n\r\n  return createClient<Database>(SUPABASE_URL, supabaseKey, {\r\n    auth: {\r\n      autoRefreshToken: false,\r\n      persistSession: false,\r\n    },\r\n    ...global,\r\n  });\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI expect that calling `auth.refreshToken` will return a refreshed provider token. I don't care as much about the GoTrue session as I do about the Google API session. \r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n## System information\r\n\r\n- OS: macOS\r\n- Browser: Chrome\r\n- Version of supabase-js: 2.7.1\r\n- Version of Node.js: v18.13.0\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n",

That's good to know.\r\n\r\nThat being the case, I wish Supabase made it possible for me to initiate the OAuth with Google and then refresh those tokens on my own. As it is, I can't use Supabase for any step because the refresh tokens are not provided after Google OAuth (maybe this is the real issue). There's a `provider_refresh_token` property but it's nullish for Google OAuth sessions even though Google's API documentation and OAuth Playground show that they provide refresh tokens.\r\n\r\nI want Supabase to help with OAuth for API access but I'm looking at implementing it separately. This isn't hard but it was a bad experience working through the Supabase issues only to figure out that I couldn't use it (another \"real issue\" could be that Supabase needs documentation stating that they don't handle refreshing provider tokens). I'd like to reuse the OAuth capabilities of Supabase and keep consistency in my codebase rather than implement OAuth separately so if Supabase did handle refreshing provider tokens, that would be lovely.",

            "body": "# Bug report\r\n\r\n## Describe the bug\r\n\r\nTypings are not correct when joining tables that are always NOT an array. For example, in my application we use the following query to fetch data about `figma_comments` and link to `figma_users` and `figma_files`:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst { data: comments } = await supabase\r\n    .from('figma_comments')\r\n    .select(\r\n      'created_at, resolved_at, comment, node_id, user:figma_users(handle, img_url, email), file:figma_files(file_key, name)',\r\n    )\r\n    .order('created_at', { ascending: false });\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom this query, I would expect the built in typings to have both `user` and `file` to be an entity of a singular user and a singular file. Since the constraints I set up in Postgres won\u2019t allow it to be multiple entries because the foreign key is unique on the joinable tables.\r\n\r\nHere is an overview of the types being generated by supabase CLI:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nTables: {\r\n      figma_comments: {\r\n        Row: {\r\n          comment: string;\r\n          created_at: string;\r\n          figma_user_id: string;\r\n          file_key: string;\r\n          id: number;\r\n          node_id: string;\r\n          order_id: number | null;\r\n          parent_id: string | null;\r\n          resolved_at: string | null;\r\n        };\r\n        Insert: {\r\n          comment: string;\r\n          created_at?: string;\r\n          figma_user_id: string;\r\n          file_key: string;\r\n          id?: number;\r\n          node_id: string;\r\n          order_id?: number | null;\r\n          parent_id?: string | null;\r\n          resolved_at?: string | null;\r\n        };\r\n        Update: {\r\n          comment?: string;\r\n          created_at?: string;\r\n          figma_user_id?: string;\r\n          file_key?: string;\r\n          id?: number;\r\n          node_id?: string;\r\n          order_id?: number | null;\r\n          parent_id?: string | null;\r\n          resolved_at?: string | null;\r\n        };\r\n      };\r\n      figma_files: {\r\n        Row: {\r\n          editor_type: string | null;\r\n          figma_project_id: number | null;\r\n          file_key: string;\r\n          id: number;\r\n          last_modified: string;\r\n          name: string;\r\n          thumbnail_url: string;\r\n          version: string | null;\r\n        };\r\n        Insert: {\r\n          editor_type?: string | null;\r\n          figma_project_id?: number | null;\r\n          file_key: string;\r\n          id?: number;\r\n          last_modified: string;\r\n          name: string;\r\n          thumbnail_url: string;\r\n          version?: string | null;\r\n        };\r\n        Update: {\r\n          editor_type?: string | null;\r\n          figma_project_id?: number | null;\r\n          file_key?: string;\r\n          id?: number;\r\n          last_modified?: string;\r\n          name?: string;\r\n          thumbnail_url?: string;\r\n          version?: string | null;\r\n        };\r\n      };\r\n      figma_users: {\r\n        Row: {\r\n          email: string;\r\n          figma_id: string;\r\n          handle: string;\r\n          id: number;\r\n          img_url: string;\r\n        };\r\n        Insert: {\r\n          email: string;\r\n          figma_id: string;\r\n          handle: string;\r\n          id?: number;\r\n          img_url: string;\r\n        };\r\n        Update: {\r\n          email?: string;\r\n          figma_id?: string;\r\n          handle?: string;\r\n          id?: number;\r\n          img_url?: string;\r\n        };\r\n      };\r\n    };\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI would expect the built in typings to know that user and file in the case of my query is an object if the entity, not an array of objects. This is because `figma_files.file_key` and `figma_users.figma_id` are set to UNIQUE.\r\n\r\nI understand that making this work might be extremely difficult, but does anyone have any suggestions on how to make the typings work for me so I do not have to cast these types?\r\n\r\n## System information\r\n\r\n- OS: macOS\r\n- Version of supabase-js: 2.10.0\r\n- Version of Node.js: v16.13.0\r\n",

If you are looking for help, please try these first:\r\n\r\n- Docs: https://docs.supabase.com\r\n- Discussions: https://github.com/supabase/supabase/discussions\r\n- Discord: https://discord.supabase.com\r\n\r\nBefore opening a bug report, please verify the following: \r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [X ] I confirm this is a bug with Supabase, not with my own application. \r\n- [X ] I confirm I have searched the [Docs](https://docs.supabase.com), GitHub [Discussions](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/discussions), and [Discord](https://discord.supabase.com). \r\n\r\n## Describe the bug\r\n\r\nUsing `pnpm 7.29.1 ` and typescript `5.0.2` re-exported types don't resolve correctly from `@supabase/supabase-js`. See this screenshot\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/858965/228993473-650107c6-cf46-4aaa-8665-acbe21a8c49e.png)\r\n\r\nReproduction here: https://github.com/evelant/supabase-pnpm-bug\r\n`pnpm install` then open `index.ts` with vscode to see the problem.  I'm not sure if this also happens with npm/yarn or if it's a resolution issue due to pnpm's stricter (more correct) package organization.\r\n\r\n## To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. `pnpm add @supabase/supabase-js`\r\n2. add `import type { RealtimeChannel, RealtimePostgresChangesPayload } from \"@supabase/supabase-js\"` in any .ts file\r\n3. Observe `Module '\"@supabase/supabase-js\"' has no exported member 'RealtimeChannel'.`\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\nIf supabase-js is going to re-export types from `@supabase/gotrue-js`, `@supabase/realtime-js`, and `@supabase/functions-js`  they should resolve correctly in all typescript versions with all major package managers (pnpm, npm, yarn, deno).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/858965/228993473-650107c6-cf46-4aaa-8665-acbe21a8c49e.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## System information\r\n\r\n- OS: macOS\r\n- Browser (if applies) N/A\r\n- Version of supabase-js: 2.13.1\r\n- Version of Node.js: 16.19.0\r\n- Version of typescript: 5.0.2\r\n- Version of pnpm: 7.29.1\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\nI'm not exactly sure what's going wrong here. There are so many configurations and quirks with module resolution in typescript it's practically impossible to keep track of them all. I'm pretty sure other packages use a similar technique of bundling several sub-libraries together and re-exporting them like `supabase-js` does with the other `@supabase` packages so this is likely a small config issue.

This is likely a transient error. [TypeError: undefined is not a function]\r\n---\r\n\r\nAfter some trial and error, I realized that if I comment the `auth.storage` value in the Supabase `createClient()` method, like so...\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey, {\r\n  auth: {\r\n    // storage: ExpoSecureStoreAdapter as any, // <-- no more error but no storage!\r\n    autoRefreshToken: true,\r\n    persistSession: true,\r\n    detectSessionInUrl: false,\r\n  },\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe error no longer appears, which is great, but it leaves me without a working storage adapter.\r\n\r\n## To Reproduce\r\n\r\nAs I've copied the code from the docs exactly, I presume you have a repo for the Expo User Management starter app that you can experiment with to reproduce.\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nFollowing the docs exactly should not result in errors being thrown.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\n## System information\r\n\r\n- OS: Windows\r\n- Browser (if applies) n/a\r\n- Version of supabase-js: ^2.20.0\r\n- Version of Node.js: 18.15.0\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\nTested in a development build of an expo app running on an Android Pixel 4 simulator (Android Studio VDM).\r\n",

Right now because our client library is not immutable, when you try to do this with Supabase client library, some of the information is kept in the original instance causing unexpected behaviors. \r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nconst restaurantsTable = supabase.from('restaurants')\r\n\r\nconst { data: restaurant } = await restaurantsTable.select().eq('id', id).single()\r\nconst { data: restaurants } = await restaurantsTable.select() // the query here will contain the `eq` and `single` statement from the previous line\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nStoring part of a query in a variable and running multiple queries using it should return the proper data. \r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\nMaybe this is something to keep in mind when doing the next major release. \r\n",

Create a query such as `client.from('table').select('*')` and await it\r\n2. Notice the response type has the correct typings\r\n3. Modify the query to not await, but store the query in a variable\r\n4. Await the stored variable, notice the response type is gone\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\nWorks:\r\n```ts\r\nconst result = await client.from('table').select('*')\r\n```\r\n\r\nBreaks:\r\n```ts\r\nconst query = client.from('table').select('*')\r\nconst result = await client\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI would expect that the query builder holds onto the type data and further query refinements also contain the type data.\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\nThe use case here is conditional queries. For example:\r\n\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst query = client.from('table').select('*')\r\n\r\nif(filterByType) query = query.eq('type', typeFilter)\r\n\r\nconst result = await client\r\n```",

Meaning if I have 5 components fetching data, all those 5 needs that extra option of `persistSession` or the warnings won't go away.\n\nYou are correct, doing this project wise will result in side effects. My suggestion is to warn it once per singleton. So middelware shows once, then RSC instantiates as a singleton and shows again, subsequent instantiates will not show it. \n\nThe local solution for me is another factory function around your factory functions that sets it as default, this would solve it but makes the code a bit less extensible.\n\nI suggest an update to the docs here: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/tutorials/with-nextjs So each code snippet actually includes persistSession. \n\nThis could be seen as a bug or a docs issue depending on what you guys think is best.",

Actually we can do further more restructuring with the test folder; like right now we have a `helper.test.ts` and a `helpers.test.ts` file where both are testing the functions defined in lib/helpers.ts so why not do something like this:\r\n\r\n> \r\n\r\n    .\r\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 test         \r\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 utils \r\n    \u2502           \u251c\u2500\u2500 constants.ts      \r\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500supabase        \r\n    \u2502          \u2514\u2500\u2500 helpers.test.ts\r\n    \u2502          \u2514\u2500\u2500 client.test.ts\r\n    \u2502          \u2514\u2500\u2500 ....\r\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 ...\r\n\r\n>\r\n\r\nAlso the `constants.test.ts` file is just checking the type of the DEFAULT_HEADERS object which seems unnecessary so instead we can add a static type check like this:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport const DEFAULT_HEADERS: {[key: string]: string} = {\r\n  'X-Client-Info': `supabase-js/${version}`,\r\n};\r\n```\r\nFeel free to suggest anything you feel can be done to further improve this :)\r\n\r\n",

In this case, the excluded column contains the encrypted data, not the plaintext (that plaintext isn't included in any column of the excluded row, that comes from the _view_) so it ends up being double encrypted.\r\n\r\nThe view does have both columns, but the second issue is that you cannot usefully `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT` to a view, because a conflict clause requires a unique constraint violation, and views do not have constraints.  So even if problem 1 didn't exist problem 2 would prevent it.\r\n\r\nThe only workaround we can think of for the moment is to use and RPC function to do the upsert, joining the table and the view and doing `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET ..., t.secret = v.decrypted_secret` and this will decrypt the column using the view, then reencrypt it using the table trigger.  I'll try and come up with a working example for you and drop it here in a comment.",

When I call this function from SQL editor, it is working as expected. However, when I try to call it via supabase-js, I'm getting the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  error: {\r\n    code: 'PGRST202',\r\n    details: 'Searched for the function public.get_unconfirmed_users without parameters or with a single unnamed json/jsonb parameter, but no matches were found in the schema cache.',\r\n    hint: null,\r\n    message: 'Could not find the function public.get_unconfirmed_users without parameters in the schema cache'\r\n  },\r\n  data: null,\r\n  count: null,\r\n  status: 404,\r\n  statusText: 'Not Found'\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create `public.users` by running the below query in SQL editor:\r\n```\r\ncreate table \"public\".\"users\" (\r\n    \"id\" uuid not null,\r\n    \"full_name\" text,\r\n    \"avatar_url\" text,\r\n    \"billing_address\" jsonb,\r\n    \"payment_method\" jsonb,\r\n    \"credits\" integer not null default 10,\r\n    \"email\" text not null,\r\n    \"email_verify_retry_count\" smallint not null default '0'::smallint,\r\n    \"is_email_verified\" boolean not null default false\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Create `get_unconfirmed_users` function by running the below query in SQL editor:\r\n\r\n```\r\nDROP function IF EXISTS get_unconfirmed_users;\r\n\r\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_unconfirmed_users() RETURNS TABLE (\r\n  email VARCHAR,\r\n  confirmation_token VARCHAR,\r\n  email_verify_retry_count int2\r\n) AS $$\r\nBEGIN\r\n  RETURN QUERY\r\n  SELECT \r\n    auth_users.email, \r\n    auth_users.confirmation_token,\r\n    public_users.email_verify_retry_count\r\n  FROM \r\n    auth.users as auth_users\r\n  JOIN \r\n    public.users as public_users \r\n    ON auth_users.id = public_users.id \r\n  WHERE \r\n    public_users.email_verify_retry_count < 3 \r\n    AND auth_users.email_confirmed_at IS NULL;\r\nEND; \r\n$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Clone the [rishisundar/supabase-function-issue-demo](https://github.com/rishisundar/supabase-function-issue-demo), install the dependencies with `yarn` and then run the sample script using `yarn start`.\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\nReturn data similar to what I'm getting in SQL editor.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n1.

This is my code:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nawait supabaseClient.auth.updateUser({\r\n            data: {\r\n                ...metadata,\r\n                ...updatedMetadata\r\n            }\r\n        })\r\n        const { error } = await supabaseClient.auth.refreshSession()\r\n```\r\n\r\nBasically, the first time I update any user metadata, it works perfectly, but the second time and all times after that I get the error \"Invalid Refresh Token: Already Used\"\r\n\r\nAs seen [here](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/14708) and [here](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/15349), other people are also facing this issue.\r\n\r\n## To Reproduce\r\n\r\n- Create a Next app with an authenticated user\r\n- call `updateUser`, then `refreshSession`\r\n- Try to `updateUser`, then `refreshSession` again, and you will get error \"Invalid Refresh Token: Already Used\"\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI expect the `refreshSession` to also refetch a new refresh-token, while refetching updated account information for the `useUser` hook.\r\n\r\nBeing able to use the `user_metadata` field for small personal user preferences is super good for DX. I always cringed at the idea of creating some Postgres triggers (that last I checked weren't even production ready) only to create a matching `public.users` table that then contained the users data, when we could just use the `user_metadata` itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n## System information\r\n\r\n- OS: macOS\r\n- Browser (if applies) Chrome\r\n- Version of supabase-js: 2.26.0\r\n- Version of Node.js: v18.15.0",

If you are looking for help, please try these first:\r\n\r\n- Docs: https://docs.supabase.com\r\n- Discussions: https://github.com/supabase/supabase/discussions\r\n- Discord: https://discord.supabase.com\r\n\r\nBefore opening a bug report, please verify the following: \r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [x] I confirm this is a bug with Supabase, not with my own application. \r\n- [x] I confirm I have searched the [Docs](https://docs.supabase.com), GitHub [Discussions](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/discussions), and [Discord](https://discord.supabase.com). \r\n\r\n## Describe the bug\r\n\r\nI have a Vue/Nuxt project with TypeScript which is throwing me an error with the profile table when I try to assign it to a variable based on the types generated from the DB. \"Type instantiation is excessively deep and possibly infinite.\"\r\n\r\nThe problematic column in question is one called \"links\" which stores JSONB data. The type that is generated from the Supabase Cli using the command `npx supabase gen types typescript` creates a self referencing type called `Json`.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nexport type Json =\r\n  | string\r\n  | number\r\n  | boolean\r\n  | null\r\n  | { [key: string]: Json | undefined }\r\n  | Json[]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith my (generated) profile row types looking like:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nprofile: {\r\n  Row: {\r\n    about: string | null\r\n    available: string | null\r\n    avatar: string | null\r\n    avatar_url: string | null\r\n    created_at: string | null\r\n    id: number\r\n    links: Json | null // this is the problematic column.\r\n    location: string | null\r\n    name: string | null\r\n    poster: string | null\r\n    poster_url: string | null\r\n    tagline: string | null\r\n    updated_at: string\r\n    user_id: string\r\n    username: string | null\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn my Pinia Vue store I get the following error when trying to assign it against these types.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport type { Database } from '@/types/supabase'\r\nimport { defineStore } from 'pinia'\r\n\r\nexport const useUserStore = defineStore('user', {\r\n  state: () => ({\r\n    profile: null as Database['public']['Tables']['profile']['Row'] | null\r\n  }),\r\n  actions: {\r\n    setProfile(profile: Database['public']['Tables']['profile']['Row'] | null) {\r\n      this.profile = profile // Here is where the TS error occurs.\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm guessing this error happens because the generated type is self referencing and TS does not know how deep it would be?\r\n\r\n## To Reproduce\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior, please provide code snippets or a repository:\r\n\r\n1. Create a column and set its type to jsonb\r\n2. Generate types using the Supabase Cli\r\n3. Try to do something similar and see that TS complains.\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThere should be no TS error.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n<img width=\"340\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-07-15 at 21 02 12\" src=\"https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js/assets/4269460/d98a5ce2-0ffd-47db-948a-49cc1a5558e4\">\r\n<img width=\"654\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-07-15 at 21 16 15\" src=\"https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js/assets/4269460/8dd77439-b203-4e7f-a9f8-f4f78678a859\">\r\n\r\n## System information\r\n\r\n- OS: Apple Macbook Pro M2 Ventura 13.4\r\n- Version of supabase-js: 2.26.0\r\n- Version of Node.js: 18.16.0\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\nI have not been able to see similar issues with other Supabase users but perhaps the use of JSONB is quite rare?\r\n",

I followed the documentation but when i click to login, i'm redirected to the google login page, i choose the user that i want, and then i'm redirect to my app but not connected. I see the new user in the database with the status \"never\" in the row \"Last Sign In\". When i try again that row update with the current date but in my app i'm not logged in.\r\n\r\n\r\n## To Reproduce\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior, please provide code snippets or a repository:\r\n\r\n1. Go tologin\r\n2. Click on google button\r\n3. redirected to my website but not connected\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI want to be connected after the google redirection.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n\r\nthis is my login function : https://gyazo.com/bd500927a2a5331ec5a54ff34ab87204\r\n\r\nthis the URL i got when i'm redirect to my website : https://gyazo.com/73724c00ad7a62ce9be91e7b90a81385\r\n\r\n## System information\r\n\r\n- OS: widnows\r\n- Browser (if applies) chrome\r\n- Version of supabase-js: 2.31.0\r\n- Version of Node.js: v16.14.2\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\nAdd any other context about the problem here.\r\n",

I previously managed to reset the password and it seems to be a new bug. Also in the docs (supabase-js) there is a section for React apps that wasn't there before. The example is ridiculous since if this is the only way to detect for RESET-PASSWORD event and the only way to do so is by prompting the user, what about UX?

                    "body": "It seems like you're encountering an issue with Supabase when creating a client using the service_role secret instead of the public_anon key. The error message you're receiving is 'PGRST301' with the details 'JWSError JWSInvalidSignature'. Let's try to resolve this issue step by step.\r\n\r\nFirst, ensure that you've set up your environment variables correctly in your `.env` file. Double-check that `ENV.PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `ENV.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` contain the correct values.\r\n\r\nNext, let's look at your `createClient` function and server-side code. It appears that you're using the Supabase JavaScript client library (`@supabase/supabase-js`). Ensure that you have installed the correct version of this library (v2.21.0).\r\n\r\nIn your `createClient` function, you are passing the `ENV.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` as the second parameter, which should be the service role secret. This seems correct.\r\n\r\nNow, let's focus on the error message 'JWSInvalidSignature.' This error suggests that there might be an issue with the JWT (JSON Web Token) signature. Here are a few steps to investigate and resolve this:\r\n\r\n1. **Regenerate Service Role Secret**: Ensure that the service role secret you are using is valid and hasn't expired. If you suspect any issues with it, regenerate a new one from the Supabase dashboard.\r\n\r\n2. **Check Permissions**: Make sure that the service role has the necessary permissions to perform the `upsert` operation on the `billing_products` table. You can check and modify these permissions in your Supabase dashboard under \"SQL Editor.\"\r\n\r\n3. **Update Supabase Client**: Check if there are any updates to the Supabase client library. It's a good practice to keep your dependencies up-to-date.\r\n\r\n4. **Error Handling**: In your code, you are logging the error message, but you might want to log more details to help with debugging. Modify your error handling to log additional information, such as the response from Supabase.\r\n\r\nHere's an updated version of your server function with improved error logging:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nexport async function upsertProductRecord(stripeProduct: Stripe.Product) {\r\n  const product = stripeProductSchema.parse(stripeProduct);\r\n  const { error, data, status } = await supabaseAdmin\r\n    .from(\"billing_products\")\r\n    .upsert(product);\r\n\r\n  if (error) {\r\n    console.error(\"Error during upsert:\", error.message);\r\n    console.error(\"Supabase Status Code:\", status);\r\n    console.error(\"Supabase Error Details:\", error.details);\r\n    throw error;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  // Handle success or use the data variable if needed.\r\n  return data;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy logging more details about the error, you should be able to get a better understanding of what's causing the 'JWSInvalidSignature' error and take appropriate actions to resolve it.\r\n\r\nRemember to perform these steps and ensure that your environment variables, permissions, and library versions are all correct. If the issue persists, consider reaching out to Supabase support for further assistance, as it could be related to specific configurations in your Supabase project.",

Even a small difference in the key can lead to authentication errors.\r\n\r\nJWT Configuration: Verify that your JWT (JSON Web Token) configuration in Supabase is set up correctly. Check the algorithm used for signing and verifying JWTs and make sure it aligns with your code.\r\n\r\nLibrary Compatibility: Ensure that the JWT library or tool you're using in your code (e.g., jsonwebtoken) is compatible with the JWT settings and key format used by Supabase. Make sure you're using the latest version of the library.\r\n\r\nEnvironment Variables: Review your environment variables meticulously. Even a minor typo or special character can cause issues. Recheck that ENV.PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL and ENV.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY are correctly set.\r\n\r\nService Role Permissions: While the service role key bypasses Row-Level Security (RLS), confirm that the service role itself has the necessary permissions to access tables and perform the 'upsert' operation.\r\n\r\nSupabase Project Settings: Look into your Supabase project settings and custom security rules. There could be configurations affecting JWT verification.\r\n\r\nSupabase Version: Ensure you are using a compatible version of Supabase. Check for updates or bug fixes related to JWT authentication in newer releases.\r\n\r\nLogging and Debugging: Implement more detailed logging during the JWT verification process. Log the token, headers, payloads, and any error details to gain insights into what's going wrong.\r\n\r\nIf after revisiting these aspects the issue persists, it might be worth reaching out to a security expert or seeking assistance from Supabase's community or support channels.

If you are looking for help, please try these first:\r\n\r\n- Docs: https://docs.supabase.com\r\n- Discussions: https://github.com/supabase/supabase/discussions\r\n- Discord: https://discord.supabase.com\r\n\r\nBefore opening a bug report, please verify the following: \r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [x] I confirm this is a bug with Supabase, not with my own application. \r\n- [x] I confirm I have searched the [Docs](https://docs.supabase.com), GitHub [Discussions](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/discussions), and [Discord](https://discord.supabase.com). \r\n\r\n## Describe the bug\r\n\r\nBoth with Postgrest.js and generated TypeScript types Bigint types such as IDs are not represented well. With the default `number` JS representation of Bigint IDs the queries start breaking because of overflowing numbers. This is especially problematic when using a [ID format](https://instagram-engineering.com/sharding-ids-at-instagram-1cf5a71e5a5c) that very frequently results in numbers larger than `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`.\r\n\r\nPostgrest supports queries such as `id::text`, however Supabase support for this leaves a lot to be desired. Two issues off the top of my head:\r\n\r\n1. API returns incorrect IDs when Bigint values overflow what JS number type allows. This results in scenarios such as this:\r\n    - Create a row and ask it to return all the fields `*`.\r\n    - Redirect the user to a page such as `/items/<id>`\r\n    - Get 404 because the ID doesn't exists. It was incorrect because of overflowing number value.\r\n   \r\n    This can be sort of worked around using the casting syntax. But unfortunately;\r\n\r\n2. Postgrest.js doesn't support casting syntax such as `id::text`. Neither the issue from nearly a year ago https://github.com/supabase/postgrest-js/issues/370 nor my PR https://github.com/supabase/postgrest-js/pull/429 received a response from Supabase team.\r\n\r\n3. Generated types don't allow inserting Bigint or String values. Postgrest seem to be happy with passing string values however the types are generated like so:\r\n```ts\r\nexport interface Database {\r\n  public: {\r\n    Tables: {\r\n      table_one: {\r\n        Row: {\r\n          id: number;\r\n          foreign_id: number | null;\r\n        };\r\n        Insert: {\r\n          id?: number;\r\n          foreign_id?: number | null;\r\n        };\r\n        Update: {\r\n          id?: number;\r\n          foreign_id?: number | null;\r\n        };\r\n        Relationships: [\r\n          {\r\n            foreignKeyName: \"table_two_id_fkey\";\r\n            columns: [\"foreign_id\"];\r\n            referencedRelation: \"table_two\";\r\n            referencedColumns: [\"id\"];\r\n          },\r\n        ];\r\n      };\r\n    };\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nA query like this results in an error:\r\n```ts\r\n    await this.supabase\r\n      .from(\"table_one\")\r\n      .insert({ foreign_id: \"2193192389123\" });\r\n```\r\n\r\n## To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create a table with Bigint ids, and columns with Bigint references to other tables with Bigint ids. \r\n3. Insert data with larger ID values than `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`\r\n2. Perform standard CRUD operations with JS SDK using TypeScript.\r\n3. Observe the issues such as wrong IDs being returned (runtime bug) and TypeScript errors (compile time bug)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nSupabase detects Bigint values, returns correct responses and generates correct code. Bigints seem to be handled better in Supabase Console with special treatment, however user code is still affected. Some possible fixes:\r\n\r\n- Large Bigint values (or all Bigint values) are detected and returned as strings in query results.\r\n- Generated types are updated to include string and/or JS Bigint types.\r\n- Type casts are supported in generated TypeScript types\r\n- String or JS Bigint values are supported when inserting / updating data.\r\n\r\n## System information\r\n\r\n- OS: macOS\r\n- Browser (if applies) Chrome\r\n- Version of supabase-js: 2.36.0\r\n- Version of Node.js: v18.17.1\r\n",

It turns out this issue is not directly related to Supabase but rather a limitation within JavaScript itself when handling large integers.\r\n\r\nBy default, JavaScript's `Number` type can only safely represent integers up to \\(2^{53} - 1\\) (i.e., `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`, which equals `9007199254740991`). When an integer exceeds this limit, JavaScript may not represent it accurately, which was the reason behind the trailing \"00\".\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nThe solution is to use JavaScript's `BigInt` type for handling large integer IDs:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst bigNumber = BigInt(data[0].id);\r\nconsole.log(bigNumber);\r\nBy using BigInt, we can ensure that the IDs fetched from the database are represented accurately, thus preserving data integrity.\r\n```\r\n## Conclusion\r\nIf you're facing a similar issue, consider switching to BigInt for large integer values.\r\n\r\nI'm closing this issue as it's been resolved. Feel free to reopen if you have any more questions or need further clarification.",

Essentially all emojis that don't have reference in the related_emojis table.\r\n\r\nIf I ran the query bellow I get all emojis and their related ones correctly:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\n .from(\"emojis\")\r\n  .select(\"id, symbol, name, related_emojis!source_emoji(source_emoji)\")\r\n\r\n/*response example:\r\n\r\ndata [\r\n  {\r\n    id: '9606dcb8-8b45-4fb9-8295-a7f05301262f',\r\n    symbol: '\ud83d\ude07',\r\n    name: 'Angel',\r\n    related_emojis: [ [Object] ]\r\n  }\r\n] \r\n*/\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem occurs when I try to filter the query to only get the emojis **without** related ones.\r\nEssentially, get all the emojis that are not linked in the `related_emojis` table:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\n  .from(\"emojis\")\r\n  .select(\"id, symbol, name, related_emojis!source_emoji(source_emoji)\")\r\n  .is(\"related_emojis.source_emoji(source_emoji)\", null)\r\n  \r\n  /*response with the unexpected behaviour:\r\ndata [\r\n  {\r\n    id: '9606dcb8-8b45-4fb9-8295-a7f05301262f',\r\n    symbol: '\ud83d\ude07',\r\n    name: 'Angel',\r\n    related_emojis: [] // <<-- Object was removed from the response\r\n  }\r\n] \r\n```\r\nInstead of filtering the query Supabase is removing the `related_emojis` Object from the response.\r\nIt seems like the filter is manipulating the response instead of filtering.\r\n\r\nI've tried other queries and they all produce the same unexpected behaviour, for example:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\n  .from(\"emojis\")\r\n  .select(\"symbol, name, related_emojis!source_emoji(emojis!related_emoji(id))\")\r\n  .is(\"related_emojis.emojis.id\", null)\r\n\r\n/* this one is particularly interesting because it adds null to the response explicitly \r\n\r\ndata [\r\n  {\r\n    id: '9606dcb8-8b45-4fb9-8295-a7f05301262f',\r\n    symbol: '\ud83d\ude07',\r\n    name: 'Angel',\r\n    related_emojis: [ { emojis: null } ] // <<-- here\r\n  }\r\n] \r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## To Reproduce\r\n\r\nCreate a recursive many-to-many relationship (ref: https://postgrest.org/en/stable/references/api/resource_embedding.html#recursive-many-to-many)\r\n\r\nAnd try to query in a way to get all the rows that are not linked in the junction table.\r\n\r\nHere's a good reference for what I'm trying to do. Please scroll to \"Null conditions for anti-joins\"\r\nhttps://catjam.fi/articles/postgrest-joins\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI'd expect the filter to return all the Emojis that are not contained in the related_emojis table.",

Instead you need to remember to invoke `throwOnError()` after every query. This change was previously made and discussed here: https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js/issues/32, and it seems others share my same concern.\r\n\r\nThis is (IMO) an unusual behavior for an API where errors are silent by default. `.update()` mutations that fail can easily go unnoticed for example. \r\n\r\nOther popular libraries i use on a regular basis such as Prisma, Zod, etc. instead throw by default, and you either have to catch the error, or opt into the API that doesn't throw and returns an error object (see [Zod docs for example](https://zod.dev/?id=safeparse)).\r\n\r\ncc @n-sviridenko, @rienheuver\r\n",

Just `throwOnError: true` would be fantastic. \r\n\r\nPlus, if this feature is enabled globally, any call should automatically return `response.data` instead of the encapsulated `{ data }` object. Right now, my code is littered with `.throwOnError().then(res => res.data)` for every call to Supabase. \r\n\r\nMany new Supabase users make the mistake of not handling errors from the sdk correctly, and end up wasting time figuring out issues because of that.

I would go so far as to say that going with the result pattern by default was a bold design choice but also a highly questionable one. Throwing on errors should be the default in any library. Returning result objects is useful in certain scenarios but should be implemented in the application instead of in a library. For our project it is cumbersome to integrate with supabase for the reasons mentioned in this thread.\r\n\r\nDownsides of the Result pattern:\r\n\r\n - There is no universal convention on how a result object is suppposed to look like, especially the error object. \r\n - You either have to opt into this pattern for the rest of the application or employ nasty workarounds to get the usual throwing-behavior (`throwOnError`).\r\n - Libraries should not make design choices on that level. Rather, employ the standard error handling behavior and have consumers of the library wrap the API calls if they want to use the result pattern.\r\n - Constructs like Promise.all don't work with the result pattern.\r\n - It interferes with certain centralized error-handling strategies.\r\n - The client code gets nasty as soon as you make more than one request in a single scope, as `data` and `error` need to be renamed for every request.\r\n\r\nThere is nothin wrong with having an option for using result objects instead of standard error handling, but it should be opt-in and not the default.\r\n\r\nI'd like to ask you to at least consider changing this in the next major release.\r\n",

I'm using Twilio. This code path was previously working as of 2 days ago, and with no code changes, new users are unable to sign up. \r\n\r\n**Currently**\r\n1. Users are able to sign up, and a row for them is created in the auth.users table. \r\n2. They also receive the OTP via Twilio\r\n3. After entering the OTP, we get a 500 internal server error from supabase saying \"Error confirming user\".\r\n\r\n## To Reproduce\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior, please provide code snippets or a repository:\r\n\r\nThe snippet for signing the user up. I've verified the phone and password are working correctly.\r\n```\r\nconst { data, error } = await supabaseClient.auth.signUp({\r\n            phone,\r\n            password\r\n        });\r\n```\r\nThe response of this call is successful. Then I make the following call once the user enters their OTP\r\n```\r\nconst { data, error } = await supabaseClient.auth.verifyOtp({\r\n            phone,\r\n            token: otp,\r\n            type: 'sms'\r\n        });\r\nif (error) {\r\n            console.error('Error verifying OTP:', error.message);\r\n        }\r\n```\r\nThis logs: Error verifying OTP: Error confirming user. The supabase /auth/v1/verify posts with a 500 as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI expect the OTP code to successfully verify the user and the verifyOtp() call to succeed (as it was doing a few days ago).\r\n\r\n## System information\r\n\r\n- OS: macOS\r\n- Browser: N/A (electron + react app) \r\n- Version of supabase-js: 2.38.2, 2.38.1, 2.38.0\r\n- Version of Node.js: 18.16.1\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\nSign up was fully working for me a few days ago with the same exact code (I was on version 2.38.0). I'm not sure what has changed to cause this to happen. I couldn't find this error anywhere on the docs or issues or posts. Given that I'm the first to report this, I'm sure I'm doing something wrong somewhere. Perhaps there's some twilio setting that has been changed -- but it seems unlikely as I haven't touched my twilio, and the codes are being sent. \r\n\r\nNote: when I pass the code in again (verify it again) the next call fails w/ a 401 Error verifying OTP: Token has expired or is invalid. Which means supabase is doing something.",

Make sure relevant URLs are correctly added to Supabase's `Redirect URLs` list\r\n2. Send a `signInWithOtp` with the `emailRedirectTo` as an option. Example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nsupabase.auth.signInWithOtp({\r\n  email: email,\r\n  options: {\r\n    emailRedirectTo: 'http://localhost:5173',\r\n  },\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe value of  `{{ .SiteURL }}` should match the value passed via `emailRedirectTo`. Instead, the default Site URL (as defined in the Supabase configuration) is set.\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\n- When authenticating via OAUTH, and defining `redirectTo`, the `{{ .SiteURL }}` value is properly overridden. However, the `signInWithOtp` requires a `emailRedirectTo` option and this option does not override `{{ .SiteURL }}`.\r\n- The `{{ .ConfirmationURL }}` value is properly updated when setting `emailRedirectTo`. However,  `{{ .SiteURL }}` should also be set accordingly.\r\n\r\n`emailRedirectTo` should override  `{{ .SiteURL }}` as that is what is expected and is necessary to have properly functioning email templates across different environments.",

The supabase-js client library loads fine when I run `deno test --allow-all ./tests/jl-call-test.ts --env=./functions/.env.local`. However, the functions server shuts down with the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSegmentation fault (core dumped)\r\nerror running container: exit 139\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich happens at\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst client = createClient(\r\n      supabaseUrl, \r\n      supabaseKey, {\r\n        auth: {\r\n          autoRefreshToken: false,\r\n          persistSession: false,\r\n          detectSessionInUrl: false,\r\n        },\r\n        db: {\r\n          schema: 'custom_schema_name'\r\n        }\r\n      })\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs I said the above snippet runs perfectly well in my unit test. Running with the --debug flag outputs no extra information. \r\n\r\nWeirdly, if I remove the supabase-js client logic, my function is responsive in local development and works as expected. Any idea what might be going on here?

Delete does not error for not finding rows to delete.\r\n```\r\nUsing DELETE for a policy means that it will apply to DELETE commands. Only rows that pass this policy will be seen by a DELETE command. There can be rows that are visible through a SELECT that are not available for deletion, if they do not pass the USING expression for the DELETE policy.\r\n\r\nIn most cases a DELETE command also needs to read data from columns in the relation that it is deleting from (e.g., in a WHERE clause or a RETURNING clause). In this case, SELECT rights are also required on the relation, and the appropriate SELECT or ALL policies will be applied in addition to the DELETE policies. Thus the user must have access to the row(s) being deleted through a SELECT or ALL policy in addition to being granted permission to delete the row(s) via a DELETE or ALL policy.\r\n```\r\nhttps://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createpolicy.html\r\n",

But the operation would actually successfully update the row to `(42, 'saoirse', 'Saoirse')`. Because  `ignoreDuplicates` defaults to false. and the example operation specifies `{ onConflict: 'handle' }`. Therefore it should find row  `(1, 'saoirse', null)` and merge into it.\r\n\r\n## Describe the improvement\r\nUpdate the example. I think the example was meant to refer to the case when `{ onConflict: 'handle' }` is NOT specified. \r\nAlso the doc currently doesn't say what the optional parameters default to.\r\n\r\n## P.S\r\nI hope I am right about this - otherwise I would be very confused about how `upsert` works with the client!\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Referred https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js/issues/725#issuecomment-1578811299\r\n\r\nHowever there seems to be some incompatibility present; Next.js [patched `fetch` API](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/fetch) does not seem to be applied to Supabase's fetch, resulting data cache completely not to work.\r\n\r\n## To Reproduce\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior, please provide code snippets or a repository:\r\n\r\nThere is a [sample project](https://github.com/susemeee/next-get-ip) for reproduction.\r\n\r\n1. Build and deploy sample project\r\n    - *A supabase project and deployment target should've set up; I used CloudFlare*\r\n3. Data caching and API such as `revalidateTag` from Next.js does not work properly, compared to [direct usage of `fetch` API](https://github.com/susemeee/next-get-ip/blob/ca3a9b89798b1d69cf448efc52e73bc30fdd6046/app/page.tsx#L10) in the test code\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nWhether `fetch` is used directly or via Supabase API the data cache should be used.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\nIf applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.\r\n\r\n## System information\r\n\r\n- Version of supabase-js: 2.38.4\r\n- Version of Node.js: v20.2.0\r\n- Version of Next.js: v13.5.4\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\nAdd any other context about the problem here.\r\n",
